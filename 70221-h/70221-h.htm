<p class="justify">These curious veiled people of the Sahara are
said to have been driven out of North Africa many centuries ago.
They were forced south into the desert, where they have ever since
remained, seemingly preferring this lonely existence to contact
with a more civilized world. The “litham,” or veil, covering the
face is primarily designed to keep out the choking desert sand.</p>

<span class="med">AND</span><br>
ACROSS THE GREAT SAHARA</p>

<h2 class="nopb">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="chap_sum">Reasons for the journey — Selecting a servant —
Preparations — The Sierra Leone Railway.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AFRICA, like India, seems often to cast a spell
over those who visit it, and certainly at the end of 1909 I found
myself under this curious fascination. I had spent some years
soldiering in West Africa, and had often wished to explore the
ramifications of the Upper and Middle Niger, but the difficulty of
obtaining sufficient leave had been an insurmountable obstacle. My
chance came at last, however, when I found myself quartered at
Freetown, the capital of our British colony of Sierra Leone, and
due for six months’ leave.</p>

<p>I determined to spend my furlough in a journey down the river
from its source, making shooting excursions at suitable points in
its basin, and directing my steps towards Timbuctu. From Timbuctu I
proposed to cross the Sahara Desert, striking almost due north for
Algiers. The strange tales I had often heard of this desert and the
curious wandering tribes who inhabit it, interested me and made me
wish to ascertain for myself the truth of them.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done was to get leave. In due course this
was obtained, and at the same time I was informed that the French
officials along my route had been told to offer me every facility
for my journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
</p>

<p>In the meantime I had not been idle, as I was well aware of the
time required before official sanction would be received. I had
calculated the kind and amount of stores necessary, and these with
my ammunition were on their way out from England.</p>

<p>In the Niger valley almost every kind of West African game is to
be found, including elephant, lion and giraffe. My armament
consisted of a ·303 magazine sporting Lee-Speed rifle, a ·450
Cordite Express and a 12-bore shot-gun. I took good care to be
amply provided with ammunition, not only for sporting purposes, but
also for self-defence, as my journey was not wholly without danger.
I calculated on getting a good supply of fresh meat by my gun, and
so my stores consisted chiefly of such articles as flour, tea, jam
and some soups. I reckoned that the journey would take about five
months, and had sufficient supplies to last me that time.</p>

<p>One of the chief difficulties was to find a servant who could
speak the requisite languages and who was willing to accompany me
to Algiers. In West Africa the language problem is always a
difficult one. Tribes are so numerous, and all speak different
languages. In many cases these languages bear not the slightest
resemblance to one another, and are exceedingly hard to acquire. By
a stroke of good fortune I succeeded in procuring a Susu native,
who had a fair idea of cooking for white men, and according to
himself, “saveed plenty all the talk master want.” This, being
interpreted into plain English, meant that he could speak fluently
the languages I required. Having had some experience of the West
African negro and his capacity for lying without turning a hair, I
took the precaution to put him to the test. He was made to
discourse at some length with a Malinké and a Bambara, these being
the two languages most necessary, and as he acquitted himself
fairly satisfactorily, I engaged him forthwith. After
crossing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span> the French
frontier these two languages were those most widely spoken until I
should enter the Sahara. Here only Tuaregs and Arabs would be met
with. I had a sufficient colloquial knowledge of Arabic for
practical purposes. Further, I knew that at the big French centres
I could always procure an interpreter if necessary; at the same
time I wished if possible to avoid having any dealings with these
gentry, as they have gained a not undeserved reputation for being
first-class rogues, who, in the name of their masters, extort
presents from the ignorant natives of the villages through which
one passes.</p>

<p>In West Africa baggage is made up in loads not exceeding sixty
pounds, and is carried by native porters on their heads.
Consequently all my possessions had to be arranged in a manner
suitable for this kind of transport. Most West African “bush paths”
are not more than three or four feet wide at most, hence carriers
have to walk in Indian file; indeed, so accustomed are they to this
mode of progression that even where Government has built wider
roads, they can never be induced to walk otherwise than one behind
the other. As paths are usually so narrow, being enclosed on each
side by dense bush, loads, besides not being too heavy, must not be
too bulky. I had altogether fourteen carrier’s loads. My plan was
to follow the Sierra Leone Railway to its terminus at Pendembu,
where I arranged to pick up my carriers.</p>

<p>One of my chief difficulties was to arrange for money on the
journey. To carry a large sum, such as would be required for the
whole expedition, on my person or in my baggage, would be highly
imprudent, and only act as a tempting bait to the numerous thieves
and highwaymen who are always met with in these countries. There
was the further complication of requiring English and French money.
After some trouble I settled with a French firm at Freetown for
drafts payable at two different places on<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_20">[20]</span> my route, and a further draft to be paid at
Marseilles. I was the more easily able to arrange this as, after
leaving Sierra Leone, the whole of my journey would be through
French possessions.</p>

<p>As it would be impossible for mails to reach me, I resigned
myself, not altogether regretfully, to being without letters for
the next five or six months. At last my preparations were complete,
and on the 6th of January I left Tower Hill Barracks to catch the
seven o’clock morning train from Freetown for Bo, where a halt is
made the first night. It was with feelings of joy at getting away
from civilization, and the delightful pleasure of knowing I should
spend the next few months in close contact with all the beauties of
nature, that I set forth that glorious tropical morning. It is
somehow easier to cast aside the gnawing cares of the world when
one is alone with nature. In tropical Africa nature is so beautiful
that the most unimaginative being can hardly fail to be stirred by
her fascinating charms and forget for the time the existence of
sordid civilization.</p>

<p>The scene that met my eye at the station was a busy and amusing
one. Most of the people present were the so-called Creoles. These
people are the inhabitants of Freetown who have become civilized
more or less, and are fond of aping the European dress and customs.
The young men wear stiff collars and starched shirts with the
gaudiest ties and handkerchiefs imaginable, while the ladies vie
with one another in the brightness of the hues of their frocks. On
their heads they wear the most brilliant coloured handkerchiefs,
and this is the prettiest part of their dress. The crowd around the
little train is so great that it is only with considerable
difficulty that one is able to approach one’s carriage. Everyone is
talking at the same time, so the noise is deafening. It must be
understood that not one-tenth part of this crowd is going in
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span> train, most of
them are only idle spectators. The departure of the train is always
a great excitement for the Sierra Leone native and invariably
attracts a large and fashionable mob. At last all preparations are
complete, the guard blows his whistle, those who are passengers are
unceremoniously bundled into the train, whilst the spectators are
as unceremoniously bundled out of the way, and amidst final
good-byes from the assembly on the platform we steam out of the
station.</p>

<p>The babel of voices having ceased, comparative quiet now reigns,
and at last I have a chance of collecting my thoughts and observing
my fellow-travellers. We are three in my compartment, all going
together as far as Bo. Each of us is provided with an ample
“chop-box,” or luncheon-basket. In West Africa it is a
well-established maxim never to get separated from two articles:
namely, one’s bedding with mosquito curtain, and one’s “chop-box.”
These two things are most necessary to one’s comfort, if not to
one’s existence. Without the bed and mosquito curtain you will be
devoured by mosquitoes, with the almost certain result of a bad
dose of fever. Without the box of provisions one runs the risk of
starvation.</p>

<p>One of my companions is a trader, who is going up-country to
investigate the advisability of starting a new store in a district
recently opened up by the railway. The Sierra Leone line has done
much to increase the trade of the colony and hinterland during the
past few years. Trade in palm kernels and ground nuts is brisk, and
the railway has quite as much as it can do to cope with the goods
traffic.</p>

<p>The other is a bank official going to Bo on some duty connected
with his bank, which has large interests in the protectorate.</p>

<p>The Sierra Leone Government Railway is a line of narrow gauge
running almost due east from Freetown for<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_22">[22]</span> 220 miles. Its terminus is at Pendembu, close
to the Liberian frontier. Officially the railway ends at Baiima,
212 miles from the capital of the colony, the last eight miles
being called a tramway, but practically there is no difference
between the railway and the tramway, and both are of identical
gauge. There is also a tramway running from Boia into the Yonni
country. Trains run three times a week in both directions.
Travelling is not comfortable judged by the standard of English
railways, the compartments are small, the seats of the carriages
are uncommonly hard, and the line is roughly laid. But greater
comfort will no doubt come in time, and it is an undoubted boon for
the traveller to have a railway of any description; in the olden
days these 200 odd miles used to take him fourteen or fifteen days
with carriers instead of only two.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="chap_sum">Bush scenery — A night at Bo — The Frontier
Force at Daru — Mendi and Kissy carriers — Cotton-growing — Secret
societies — Poro and Bundu societies — Marriage customs — The
Liberian frontier.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE country of Sierra Leone consists of two
parts: the colony and the protectorate. The colony is mountainous,
and runs out in a peninsula from the protectorate or hinterland.
Roughly speaking, the colony is the civilized part, and the
protectorate is in West African parlance the “Bush.” In the
peninsula a quantity of ginger is grown, and through these
plantations the train wends its way for some twenty miles. On the
left is the Sierra Leone or Bunce River, and on the east is a rocky
range of hills. After leaving the colony the line runs for about
120 miles through typical West African “bush” scenery to Bo. For
those who have never seen it it may be of interest to say a few
words about the West African “bush.” It generally consists of a
tangled mass of small trees and undergrowth, never more than some
thirty feet high, so thick that it is impossible to see more than
two or three yards inside it, and so dense that without cutting a
path it is not possible to force one’s way through it. This bush is
often the haunt of the smaller species of wild game, such as cerval
cats, bush pigs and small antelope; but these are difficult to see,
and still more difficult to shoot on account of the thickness of
the foliage. Every three to five years the bush is cut by its
owner, for all bush-land has a proprietor, who will make himself
known soon enough if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
anyone else attempts to appropriate his particular piece of land.
The landlord then clears the ground and makes a farm, planting
rice, ground nuts, or whatever is suited best to that locality.
This clearing process is often considerably helped by first burning
the undergrowth. Bush fires for this purpose are started in January
or February, when the vegetation has been dried by the hot tropical
sun and by the dry winds called “Harmatan,” which blow about this
time of year. After getting his crops from the land the native
allows the bush to grow up once more, and so rapid is this growth
in the luxuriant damp atmosphere, that in a few months after the
rains have commenced the untutored eye can discern no trace of the
previous existence of a farm.</p>

<p>In West Africa the area of land under cultivation is relatively
small. For miles upon miles there is this dense bush, with here and
there a clearing for a farm or a small village. Although vegetation
is so luxuriant flowers are not often seen.</p>

<p>We steamed into Bo about eight o’clock that night, very much
shaken and extremely glad to get out of the train. We arrived in
pitch darkness, the train was late, and no such luxuries as lamps
exist at this station. After much altercation between my “boy” and
the native guard my baggage was produced from the van, and I made
my way towards the rest-house, where travellers are accommodated.
My recollections of that night are not altogether pleasant ones.
After dinner I sat down in one of the madeira chairs belonging to
the rest-house, thinking I would enjoy a quiet pipe before turning
in. I had no sooner sat down, however, than a curious scrunching
noise in my chair made me start and jump up pretty quickly. I had
disturbed a scorpion, and only just discovered the fact in time to
prevent the horrible brute from biting me. The rest-house had
evidently not been inhabited for some<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_25">[25]</span> time, and the scorpion had no doubt made
himself a comfortable home in that particular chair, so nearly to
my discomfiture. An amusing scene ensued while my servant and two
other natives pursued the luckless scorpion with sticks, boots, and
anything that came handy, shouting and hurling anathemas at him all
the while. After a considerable number of lucky escapes, owing
chiefly to want of skill on the part of his pursuers, he was
finally laid low by a blow from one of my heavy marching boots, and
after this he was soon despatched, allowing me to pass the
remainder of the night undisturbed.</p>

<p class="justify">This picturesque river has a portion of its
course in Sierra Leone and a portion in Liberia. Like most of the
Sierra Leone rivers, it is too rapid to be navigable except by
canoes, although there is a direct waterway connecting it with the
sea.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The train left at eight o’clock the following morning, so I was
up betimes to secure a seat in the very small compartment which was
all that was now allotted to travellers. Our train was to take us
to Daru, a distance of eighty miles.</p>

<p>I was met at Daru by two officers of the West African Frontier
Force, who have their head-quarters here. I was kindly invited to
stay at the barracks during my sojourn at Daru, an invitation of
which I gladly availed myself.</p>

<p>The barracks are picturesquely situated on the banks of the Moa
River. The officers have a very nice mess and comfortable quarters.
They have an English-built four-oared boat on the river, where
fishing and bathing are also to be had; in addition there is a
tennis-court in the mess-grounds, so that for West Africa they are
extremely well provided for.</p>

<p>The Frontier Force Battalion in Sierra Leone is recruited from
West African natives, and is a colonial corps, the officers being
seconded from their regiments for short periods of duty under the
colonial office. The officers are keen soldiers, and the men, under
their able instruction, form excellent fighting material. They have
done a lot of good service for the Empire in West Africa ever since
they were first raised, a good many years ago. I spent
that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span> night at Daru,
and next morning despatched my servant and baggage to Pendembu by
road. In the afternoon, by the courtesy of the railway officials, I
was provided with a trolly, on which I had a ride to the end of the
railway, where I found my baggage already installed in the
rest-house by the faithful Suri, my servant.</p>

<p>That night was passed in parading my carriers and allotting to
each man his particular load. These men were to accompany me as far
as the French frontier, where I had arranged to be met by a fresh
gang. The next morning, the 9th of January, at daybreak, all was
ready for a start. My escort, consisting of a non-commissioned
officer and three men, kindly supplied by the officer commanding
the Frontier Force, were well accustomed to their work, and had all
the loads with their respective carriers ready. It was a curious
sight to see these strange figures, each man squatting behind his
load waiting for the order to raise it upon his woolly head. Their
attire was of the scantiest and raggedest description. One man
proudly displayed a threadbare frock-coat, so tattered as scarcely
to hang together on him, while another had a red and yellow
tam-o’-shanter jauntily placed on the side of his head. These
carriers are a very merry, cheerful lot; however long the day’s
march, however hot the sun may be as they trudge along with a heavy
load on their heads, they seldom grumble, but chatter away to each
other and crack jokes with their neighbours. Of course, carriers
vary a great deal, both in their value as porters and in their
disposition. The best carriers in Sierra Leone are the Mendi tribe;
these people have been accustomed for centuries to carry heavy
loads from the interior down to the big native markets near the
coast, and are hard to beat as porters. Our road now lay nearly due
north, keeping just on the British side of the Anglo-Liberian
frontier.</p>

<p>Very soon after leaving Pendembu we came into the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span> mountainous region which extends
almost uninterruptedly along the border. The bush path here was
very rough, and led us for the most part up and down steep
hill-sides. This country did not appear to be much populated;
occasionally a small village was seen half hidden in the bush. At
rare intervals we passed a man carrying a load of palm kernels on
his back, probably on his way to the nearest station of the
railway, where he would dispose of his burden at a good price to
the local trader. These people were Kissis. They have a peculiar
way of carrying their loads. A kind of basket is first made of
twisted palm leaves, in shape rather semi-cylindrical; this basket
is packed with the kernels, and is then slung in the following
manner over the back. Two braces are made, one to pass under each
armpit and over the corresponding shoulder, while a third brace
leads from the top of the basket and passes around the forehead. It
is very noticeable that men who carry loads in this fashion are not
half so well set-up as the Mendis, who always carry their loads on
the top of their heads.</p>

<p>We reached the small village of Mafindo about three o’clock that
afternoon, and here I decided to halt for the night. The chief was
summoned and told to provide myself and my party with accommodation
for that evening. I did not much relish the idea of sleeping here,
as it was a very dirty cattle town; the houses looked like
pigsties, and were evidently the habitation of cows as well as
human beings. However, it was not feasible to push on any further
that night as the next village was a long way off, so I had to make
the best of Mafindo. The village itself is half in British and half
in Liberian territory. The centre street, or alley-way, divides one
country from the other. Each portion has its own chief with its own
set of laws. A little cotton is grown in this part of Sierra Leone,
each village producing sufficient for its own needs. Cotton
is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span> grown in small
clearings close to the villages. It is picked by the women, who
also clean it and spin it. The process is as follows. The cotton
pod is rolled between two smooth stones in order to crush out the
cotton seeds; it is then spun on to wooden spindles, and at the
same time rubbed with bone dust to harden it. Cloth is usually
woven by the men. West African cotton is very short in the staple,
so that cloth is made in narrow strips about nine inches wide. To
make a garment it is necessary to sew a dozen or more of these
strips together. The cloth is coarse but of good quality. In some
parts of the country exceedingly pretty-coloured cloths are made;
some of these are quite handsome as tablecloths and similar
ornaments.</p>

<p>The people themselves have few wants in the way of clothing. The
men wear a scanty loin-cloth, and the women have a somewhat larger
one, which is thrown round the body, enveloping it from the breasts
to the feet. The children of both sexes run about naked until they
are thirteen or fourteen years of age. Most of the wealth of the
peasants of this region is in their cattle. The animals are small
and the cows give little milk; but the cattle are sturdy, hardy
little beasts, and seem seldom to suffer from sickness.</p>

<p>At last the chief came to tell me that all was ready for my
inspection, with many humble wishes that I should find my abode
comfortable. My friend was not a very imposing-looking individual.
Although a chief, he was no better clothed than his dirty, scantily
dressed fellow-citizens. He appeared to be very old as he hobbled
up, leaning heavily on a stick. His chief pleasure in life was to
take snuff, and his delight when I gave him a small present of
tobacco is not easily described. Tobacco is a most useful article
of commerce in these countries. Travellers should be careful to be
amply supplied with the fragrant leaf.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_29">[29]</span> It will buy most things in the bush, as
natives are fond of it, both for smoking and snuff-taking.</p>

<p>The country here is the northern limit of Mendiland. The Mendis
are pagans, and are to a great extent governed by the secret
society called “Poro.” The chiefs frame the laws of the country
with the help of this society, and all land under cultivation is
subject to the Poro laws with regard to the gathering of crops.
When Poro is put on a crop the owner is not allowed to gather it
until the Poro is taken off. For a civilized person it is hard to
understand the signification of Poro, or to realize the tremendous
influence it has on the Mendi people.</p>

<p>“Medicine” is often placed near the entrance to a farm to scare
away evil spirits; this is usually a little rice, or a few bananas,
or it may be some egg-shells, which are either laid on the path or
placed in an old calabash hung over the entrance supported on two
sticks. Forms of “Juju,” or “Medicine,” are varied and
peculiar.</p>

<p>Charms are also common among these people. The Mendis hold two
particular charms in great respect. One is called “Suk,” and is
warranted to bring the lucky possessor good fortune. The other is
called “Hoare,” and is used to protect the owner from evil
influences. It is made of a plant which is fairly common in the
hinterland, and which is boiled into a thick greenish substance.
This is then eaten, and has the property of increasing the drinking
powers of the consumer. This property enhances the prestige of the
individual, as the Poro society is much given to drinking.</p>

<p>The usual form of charm in West Africa consists of a few verses
of the Koran written on paper and enclosed in a leathern amulet.
These amulets are worn round the neck, on the arms, or hung up in
the house. They are also frequently found tied to horses’ tails and
manes. The Mendis, however, not being Mohammedans, do not often
indulge in this special kind of charm. The Poro society
is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span> not entirely a
good one; for instance, the Human Leopard Society, of which the
object is the murder of persons who are undesirable to the society,
is an offshoot of Poro. Boys of twelve to fourteen are circumcised
by Poro, and these are the youngest members of the organization.
Every village has a portion of bush in the vicinity allotted as the
Poro Bush, and kept sacred for the rites of the society. Anyone who
penetrates it is killed without mercy. A candidate for initiation
must obtain the consent of his relatives, who are required to stand
surety that he will not flinch or attempt to withdraw while
undergoing the ordeal. He is then confined in the Poro Bush and not
allowed to leave it or to speak until the conclusion of his
initiation. He is unexpectedly subjected to trials of fire and
attacks from wild animals. After this period of probation he is
washed, a white cap is placed on his head, and he is given a staff
decorated with beads. He is then made to swear a solemn oath never
to reveal the secrets of the society; this oath is usually
administered on a tortoiseshell, which is regarded with special
veneration by West African natives, for the tortoise is supposed to
be a beast of exceptional wisdom. After this he is taken to the
lodge of the society, which is ornamented for the occasion with
palm leaves and other foliage. He then has marks cut on his back in
the shape of triangles, with the apex on the spine and the base on
the ribs. Circles are also cut on his breast.</p>

<p>The members of Poro are summoned by a messenger bearing a branch
of a tree, on which are tied a number of pieces of stick. The
number of these sticks denotes the number of days to elapse before
the meeting will be held. Kola nuts are used as symbols of peace
and war. Two red kolas signify war, whereas a white nut broken in
two indicates peace.</p>

<p>Another curious custom which exists among the Mendis is that
many families claim to belong to different species of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> animals. Many say they are of
the bird family; these will not eat eggs. Again, others claiming to
be descended from crocodiles will not kill these animals.</p>

<p>Another secret society is the Bundu. This has for its object the
education of young girls. The teachers are mature women who
instruct the students in the duties they will have to perform as
wives and mothers. This society is a very old one. Every village
has a Bundu Bush in the same way as it has a Poro Bush. Men are not
allowed to enter under pain of death. There are many other
societies of a more or less religious nature, but these are the
most important. Women are regarded as of small consequence by these
people. They are made to work in the farm and cook food for the
husband while he remains idle. When a man wants a wife he goes to
the parents and haggles over the price to be paid. In Sierra Leone
a wife costs £3 to £4, but the price varies a good deal. The sum is
paid in the presence of witnesses and the woman becomes his wife.
Polygamy is the rule among pagans as well as among Mohammedans. The
wife has no rights; the husband can flog her or maltreat her
without the woman having any chance of redress. Girls are married
at twelve, and in many cases even at nine and ten.</p>

<p>On the 10th of January I left Mafindo, crossing the picturesque
Moa River. The inhabitants were now Kissis. The river is crossed in
dug-out canoes; these canoes are simply made from the trunk of a
tree which is roughly hewn out in the hollow form of a boat. In the
hands of a native these cumbersome and untrustworthy-looking craft
are most handy in the West African rivers. The boatman manipulates
his canoe with a single paddle, which serves not only to urge it
forward, but also to steer it. I must own that I never feel very
safe in a dug-out. One has to sit uncommonly still for fear of
capsizing, and an immersion in the swift current of the
crocodile-infested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
streams of this region would be a far from agreeable
experience.</p>

<p>The Kissis have three different masters, as a portion of their
country lies in Liberia, and yet another portion is under French
jurisdiction in Guinea. The Kissis are a war-like tribe, who have
given a good deal of trouble to the British Government. They were
constantly at war with their neighbours in Sierra Leone, the Mendis
and the Konnohs. They also joined King Samory’s Sofas in 1891, and
raided the protectorate. Their power was finally crushed in 1905 by
an expedition carried out by the Sierra Leone Battalion of the West
African Frontier Force. A great deal of the Kissy country is under
cultivation, for they are good and economical farmers. In their
farms are to be seen flourishing crops of rice, maize, and
beniseed. Their villages are badly kept, and the houses are very
small and dirty.</p>

<p>The following day we crossed the Meli River, which separates
Kissy country from the Konnoh tribe. Transport across this river is
done by a still more hazardous method than on the Moa River—on
rafts. These rafts are made of roughly-hewn logs, lashed together
with “Tie-tie.” “Tie-tie” consists of supple creepers, growing in
profusion in the bush, which are most useful in a country where no
rope is available. One’s baggage is first deposited on the raft,
forming a dry and fairly steady platform. After this the passenger
climbs warily on to the top of his worldly possessions, seating
himself cautiously so as not to upset the somewhat delicate
equilibrium of the craft. The raft is worked by a native with a
long pole, who directs its unsteady course from the stern end. If
you have any holes or weak spots in your boxes this method of
transport will unfailingly find them out. Water rushes through the
wide gaps between the logs of the raft, and miniature waves
frequently wash over the platform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
</p>

<p>Konnoh country is decidedly mountainous. It is intersected by
broken ranges of hills, rising to a height of nearly 3000 feet
above the sea. The valleys between these ranges are covered with
grass-land, the haunts of “bushcow,” as the small West African
buffalo is termed. The Konnohs are an offshoot of the great tribe
of Mandingoes, which inhabits a vast stretch of land from the
Middle Niger to the Gambia. Their country was devastated by the
Sofas about 1890, consequently a large number of the people were
exterminated or taken into slavery. Peace now reigns, however, and
the people are regaining confidence and the population is
increasing. Mohammedanism is making rapid progress among them,
although a large number are still pagans. Missionaries are scarce
in these parts; during my travels I do not recollect seeing a
single Christian among these people.</p>

<p>In the village where I stayed that night I saw what is an
unusual sight in Sierra Leone, a horse, or, to be strictly
accurate, a small and weedy-looking pony. The proud owner was the
chief, whose dignity and authority were considerably augmented by
the possession of this quadruped. The disease called
“Trypnasomiasis,” conveyed by the tsetse fly, is very prevalent in
the protectorate, and is fatal to horses and cattle. It is,
however, extremely local, certain districts being quite free from
its ravages. This probably accounts for the fact that cattle can
often live where horses cannot, for cattle never wander very far,
thus possibly not getting into the infected area, whereas horses
naturally cover greater distances and would be more likely to pass
through a tsetse fly zone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="chap_sum">Shooting in the grass-country — An unfortunate
mishap — Doubtful pleasures of a journey — Sources of the Niger — A
curious frontier rock — Bush fires — Bird-life.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the northern Konnoh country some good
bushcow shooting is obtainable. In the grass-lands before mentioned
these animals are wont to feed at night and during the early hours
of the morning, and this is the best time to come up with them.
When the sun gets hot they retire into the bush, where they remain
till late in the afternoon. They are generally to be found near
water, and appear to drink in the evening and early morning. I
spent a couple of days after these fine beasts, but did not have as
good sport as I should have had a month or two later, when the
grass is burnt. Bushcow shooting is certainly one of the most
exciting forms of sport with big game. This animal is probably one
of the most dangerous to tackle. A wounded bushcow almost
invariably charges, and is extremely vicious. In cover, such as
long grass or bush, he is exceedingly dangerous. Indeed, it is very
foolish to follow a wounded animal into such places. He will lurk
under cover, with his head turned in the direction from which he
expects his enemy, and charge when within ten yards or so. Many
serious accidents have occurred to sportsmen of late years in this
manner. Finding the grass still so high I did not linger long in
this district, but pushed on for the Tembikunda Range and the
sources of the Niger.</p>

<p>The following day I had an unfortunate mishap. It was early in
the morning and I had stopped to have a little<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_35">[35]</span> sport with some pigeon in a farm. My small
caravan, with the exception of one carrier, had gone on. I was
turning sharply to shoot a bird flying off to my right when I
struck my leg against a stump of a tree. A sharp piece of wood
about three inches long penetrated just under the knee-cap, causing
me to fall down in agony. The stick was firmly wedged in the flesh
so that the united efforts of my carrier and myself were unavailing
to extract it. I accordingly despatched him at once to stop my
caravan and summon my servant with my small medicine-case. After
cutting the flesh I was able to withdraw the piece of wood, but my
leg was now so swollen and painful that I found it impossible to
walk. The sergeant of my escort and my “boy” managed to rig up a
hammock by utilizing one of my blankets and a bamboo, and in this I
was slung, feeling more like a sack of goods than a human being,
and thus transported for the remainder of that day’s march. The
next few days were anything but a pleasant experience. I developed
bad blood-poisoning in the knee and was confined to my hammock. The
road was extremely rough, sometimes leading up the side of a
mountain, which was so steep as to appear like a veritable
precipice. When going up these inclines, in my uncomfortable
conveyance, my leg got jolted unmercifully and I suffered
excruciating pain. I think the worst day was on the 15th of
January.</p>

<p>Between the villages of Kondundu and Kundema there is a stretch
of bush for about eight miles, which contains some of the thickest,
most impenetrable cane-brake it has ever been my lot to encounter.
The path I was following was evidently little frequented, and was
some miles east of the usual trade route from the north to the
south of the protectorate. Our road lay along a swampy valley, much
overgrown with this stiff, unyielding reed. The native matchet,
which is universally used for cutting bush, was quite useless
against this stubborn fibrous stuff, and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_36">[36]</span> the only alternative was to force our way
through it. Progress was very slow. The carriers in front of me
with loads on their heads had the greatest difficulty in making a
path for themselves, whereas my hammock-men had a far harder task
in getting the unwieldy hammock through without upsetting me in the
bush. I had to be carried by two men whilst the other two bearers
hurled their weight against the reeds and made a path for us to
follow.</p>

<p>On the 16th I arrived at a small village in the Tembikunda
Range, about three miles from the spot where the Niger rises. Here
I had a great disappointment; I was informed there was no path
leading to the river source, and that the track lay over
exceedingly rough, precipitous mountains. This information proved
to be only too correct. I was quite unable to walk; and to carry a
hammock up those rugged precipices was quite impossible. I
therefore had reluctantly to give up any idea of seeing the actual
source of the great Niger River. The river is said to rise in a big
rock, which is also the source of four other rivers. These are the
Feliko, which flows into the Niger in French Guinea, the Bagwe, and
two smaller rivers. The Bagwe is one of the biggest rivers in
Sierra Leone. The Niger here is known by the name of Tembiko, or
Joliba. In the Susu language, much spoken on the upper reaches of
the stream, the word Joliba means “He who can run faster than any
other man.” There is a curious legend attached to the source of the
Niger. The natives have a superstition that a devil lurks inside
the rock where it rises. It is said that any man who is intrepid
enough to approach the rock and gaze on it will be killed by this
demon. In consequence of this sinister reputation it is the habit
of the local savage to shun the neighbourhood of the source. By
judicious bribery he can be induced to show a stranger the spot,
but his manner of so doing is peculiar. He will, on nearing the
rock, turn round and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
walk backwards towards it, at the same time covering his eyes with
one hand, so as not to see the haunted place, while with the other
hand he indicates the point where the river rises.</p>

<p>This rock forms one of the boundary marks on the Anglo-French
frontier, separating Sierra Leone from French Guinea. The stone has
inscribed on it, upon the western side, the fact that that portion
is inside the British border, and the names of the members of the
Boundary Delimitation Commission are here written. On the eastern
side it is stated that that portion is in French territory, and the
names of the Boundary Commission are also here similarly
inscribed.</p>

<p>The Niger rises at a height of under 4000 feet, in a very wild,
uninhabited country. The Tembikunda Range is exceedingly rocky and
precipitous. It consists of a rugged, broken mass of peaks; in many
cases hills are separated from each other by steep, narrow valleys
or gullies.</p>

<p>The sides of these mountains are covered with thick, grassy
bush. This grass grows to a height of twelve feet and more in the
rainy season. When ascending a peak it is impossible to see the
summit, not because it is so high, but merely because the vision is
obstructed by this tall grass. Bush fires were just commencing when
I passed through the country. It was a beautiful sight at night to
see the huge flames working their way up the steep mountain-sides,
just like fiery serpents as they coiled and twisted themselves
around some piece of bush a little greener than the rest and able
to resist them for a short moment. These fires are started by
natives in order to clear the ground, by burning down the bush, so
that they can plant their crops. When the Harmatan wind and the sun
have dried the vegetation it burns with ease. A fire thus started
rapidly spreads over many miles of country.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_38">[38]</span> It certainly does a considerable amount of
harm by killing a number of beautiful trees every year; where trees
are numerous and many are thus burnt to the ground, the tendency is
naturally to decrease the rainfall of that district. On the other
hand, it is argued that burning the bush fertilizes the soil
through the medium of the ashes of the leaves and burnt vegetation.
In any case it is a very old custom among West African natives and
one which would be extremely hard to repress. The negro is
naturally a lazy man, consequently this mode of clearing the bush
peculiarly appeals to him since it demands so little effort on his
part.</p>

<p>Bird-life is not so abundant as might be expected in Sierra
Leone. The large expanses of almost virgin bush one would almost
imagine to teem with wild birds, but this is far from being the
case. In the forest-country the hornbill is very common. These
birds are generally seen in large flocks, and assimilate well with
the solitude of their surroundings as they hover from one tree to
another with their peculiar flight, uttering their weird, mournful
cry. Their flight reminds one forcibly of a switchback working very
slowly, as they flutter first up and then downwards, in the motion
towards their goal. Hornbills often build their nests in the trunks
or branches of trees. When searching for their nests it is a common
sight to see the young birds peeping out of a snug nest almost
hidden inside the hollow of an old branch.</p>

<p>The violet plantain-eater is a beautiful bird, which is also
common in forest-land. It has a gorgeous colouring. The body is
violet and green, while the wings are a brilliant crimson. This
handsome bird has a peculiar raucous note. It is a curious fact
that singing-birds are exceedingly uncommon in West Africa. I never
recollect hearing any bird with a voice to be compared to our
nightingale or black-cap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
</p>

<p>In the region of the palm tree the golden oriole is frequently
met with. This little bird builds its nest suspended from the
branches and leaves of the tree; on a single tree as many as twenty
or thirty may be counted. They strip the tree of all its foliage
and in time kill it.</p>

<p>Among game birds the most widely distributed is one of the
francolin partridges, commonly known on the coast as the
“bushfowl.” It is found anywhere in the vicinity of a farm, and
particularly delights to feed on cassada. This bird feeds in the
early morning and again late in the afternoon, but during the heat
of the day it takes refuge from the sun in the thick bush. It has a
curious, hoarse note, by which the cock is often heard calling to
his mate in the early morning. The best time for shooting these
birds is after the grass is burnt, from March to June. Besides, the
young are full-grown by then. They appear to breed in the late
autumn, and birds hatch out in November and December. Guinea-fowl
are found in many parts of the protectorate. Coveys of twenty and
thirty are by no means unusual. Their favourite haunts are the
rice-fields, in which they feed in the morning and evening. They
prefer a feeding-ground which has thick cover on at least one side;
in this they rest during the heat of the day and at night.</p>

<p>Guinea-fowl, like bush fowl, are often seen roosting in trees.
Indeed, with the former, it is more usual to find them sitting in
trees than on the ground. A guinea-fowl is perhaps the most wary of
West African game birds. He has very keen eyesight and hearing. He
will generally have discovered your presence long before you are
aware of his, and in that case he takes alarm and is off
immediately. Guinea-fowl run far more frequently than they fly.
Once they have taken to their heels they are extremely difficult to
overtake; the only plan is to cast dignity to the winds and run at
your best pace after them.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_40">[40]</span> Even then your chance of getting a shot is
very remote, and perhaps the wisest course is to leave them alone.
Guinea-fowl in the bush-country are excellent eating, but I have
noticed that these birds when shot in a sandy region are generally
very tough. This is probably due to the different nature of food
they live on. In open country, unless the sportsman is very keen,
it is usually a safer plan to take a long shot with a rifle, rather
than attempt to stalk these very cunning birds with a shot-gun. In
the grass-country on the eastern frontier of Sierra Leone I came
across one or two button-quail. But I think these birds are
uncommon, and I never saw more than one at a time.</p>

<p>A bird locally called the grey pigeon, but in reality a large
ringdove, is very common. It feeds on maize, millet and rice, and
is seen in large numbers when the crops are ripe. In some parts of
the country a native is on duty all day in a farm when the crops
are getting ripe, his business being to scare away the birds. This
individual takes up his position on a raised platform, built of
rough bush-sticks, and placed at a suitable spot in the farm. He is
provided with a whip of some supple bush-creeper, which he cracks
with considerable noise and effect, thereby driving away any bird
which contemplates an attack on the crops.</p>

<p>The green pigeon, or at any rate one variety of it, is found in
certain localities. It is partial to water and high trees.
Frequently seen on the creeks near the sea-coast, it is also found
up-country in the forest belt. This bird is very swift of flight,
generally flying at a considerable height; it affords some sporting
shots. The colouring is a beautiful combination of green,
canary-yellow and French grey. The beak is crimson, while the legs
are yellow. It always appears to be in excellent condition, and is
a dainty morsel for the sportsman’s table.</p>

<p>In the grass-country the lesser bustard is
occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span> found.
The bird is sometimes seen in pairs, but more frequently single.
Its flight is slow, making it easy to shoot. The wings of the male
are a rich black and white, and the breast is mottled grey and tan.
A strange bird which frequents the open, rocky bush-country, is the
standard-winged night-jar. It has a peculiar habit of crouching
flat on the ground, with which its nondescript khaki colour well
assimilates. I have often been startled of an evening by the
sudden, silent way in which this creature has risen up from my
feet. During the mating season the male bird has two curious black
appendages to its tail, which add considerably to its strange
appearance, and are evidently meant to attract the female bird he
is courting.</p>

<p>The cow-bird is found in all localities where there is much
cattle or game; it serves the useful purpose of consuming the ticks
and lice on the bodies of these animals. It is black, and much
resembles a starling in size and colouring. Its beak is sharp,
enabling it to pick out these insects from their hiding-places. The
sight of one of these little birds, perched on the back of a cow or
climbing up its flanks, is distinctly comical.</p>

<p>The widow-weaver is so common that I had nearly omitted to
mention it. This is a very small black and white bird, with a tail
consisting of two streamers, about twice as long as itself, whose
habit is to flutter about from one wisp of grass to another, in a
curious, laboured fashion, just as if its unwieldy-looking tail
were too heavy for its small body, and threatened every minute to
weigh it down to the ground. These tails, like that of the
night-jar, previously described, grow to their full length in the
mating season.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="chap_sum">The Harmatan — Native burial rites — Koranko
superstitions — The Anglo-French frontier — Solitude of a Customs
post — A change of scenery — Smuggling — A change of carriers —
Intoxicating liquor — The Upper Niger — A splendid spectacle — A
good highway — Native music.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the Tembikunda Mountains I found the
variations of temperature between night and day extremely trying.
The maximum by day never exceeded ninety degrees, but at night the
temperature used sometimes to fall to under fifty degrees. The
greatest height I reached was 2480 feet. The fall of temperature
was evidently caused by the dry Harmatan wind which always blows at
this time of year. This wind is said to come from the Sahara; it
blows from the north-east for more or less long periods during the
months of December, January, February, and March, all over the West
Coast of Africa. The theory that it comes from the Sahara appears
to be supported by the fact that it contains a quantity of fine
particles of sand. Its extreme dryness is particularly noticeable
in the otherwise damp coast atmosphere. Books and papers curl up,
and the skin gets uncomfortably parched at this season. Natives are
especially susceptible to chills and pneumonia while the Harmatan
is blowing.</p>

<p>In spite of sleeping in a native hut, a place not usually
remarkable for its coolness, I used to shiver under my three
blankets. Finally, the only way I could keep sufficiently warm to
get to sleep was by lighting a huge log fire close to my bedside
before retiring to rest. Of course, the cold was not really so
intense, as the thermometer was several<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_43">[43]</span> degrees above freezing; but the sudden fall
in temperature between night and day had the unpleasant effect of
making it appear like midwinter in England.</p>

<p>A curious fact about the Harmatan is that, owing to the sand
carried by it in suspension in the air, a kind of haze is produced
which considerably restricts one’s range of vision. The effect is
very similar to that caused by a London fog. Indeed, when watching
the sunset while a strong Harmatan was blowing, I could easily
imagine myself gazing at that peculiar appearance seen in the sky
on a foggy winter’s afternoon in Town. At times this curious wind
blows with great violence. This is particularly the case in the
early morning, when even on the march a thick overcoat can be worn
without feeling in the least degree too hot.</p>

<p>The country in which I now was is inhabited by the Korankos.
Their territory is a large one, extending for a considerable
distance north and west of the Niger watershed, while a small
portion of the tribe overflows eastward into French Guinea. The
whole country is very mountainous, and the people are extremely
poor. Most of them are pagans. These Korankos suffered considerably
during the wars of Samory, when many of them were exterminated by
his Sofas. The principal town is Kruto, lying about forty miles due
west of the Niger source, and a trading centre of some importance.
At the small village of Manson I arrived on the day of the burial
of a chief’s son. The ceremony which takes place on such an
occasion is somewhat remarkable, and it was my good fortune to
witness it here.</p>

<p>The whole burial rites take three or four days, the body not
being taken to the grave till the last day, by which time, as can
be imagined, it is in an unsavoury state of decomposition, and not
fit to be approached by a white man.</p>

<p>Immediately a death occurs the womenfolk start lamenting; in the
meantime messengers are despatched to all<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_44">[44]</span> the slaves and relatives in the other
villages. As this takes some days, the body is kept in the house
till they have all arrived. In the case of a Poro man, his body is
deposited in the “Poro” Bush. No woman is permitted to look on the
corpse. Dancing, singing, and tomtoming are vigorously kept up the
whole time. The women take a leading part in this portion of the
ceremony. A woman’s body is taken to the “Bundu” Bush until the day
of burial.</p>

<p>On the burial day all the mourners plaster themselves with white
clay and follow the corpse to the burial-ground. Country cloths are
buried with the deceased, the number varying directly with his
personal wealth. The favourite hour for the interment is sunset.
After the burial guns are fired by anyone possessing a fire-arm,
with the intention of frightening away all evil spirits; at the
same time a sacrifice is made on the grave of a fowl, a sheep, or a
cow, according to the wealth of the dead man. These sacrifices are
also offered for the purpose of propitiating the dead man’s
ancestors, who, tradition says, are otherwise in the habit of
torturing his soul.</p>

<p>Directly after the burial the deceased’s property is taken
possession of by the heir, who then invites his friends to a feast,
on the principle, I suppose, of “Le roi est mort, vive le roi.” At
a burial or a marriage the one aim of the native seems to be to
spend as much money as possible.</p>

<p>Some Korankos are members of the mystical Kofung society. The
Kofung society has a large organization among the Limba people, who
inhabit the north centre of the protectorate; but it has also some
influence over the western tribes. Its rites are of a mournful,
morbid character. A candidate has to simulate death, and is
supposed to be made to return to life by the officiating members at
the initiation ceremony. As he lies on a litter, apparently dead,
the members dance round him, raise him up, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_45">[45]</span> wash his eyes with a lotion prepared from
the bark of a cork tree. When the dance is ended the candidate
stands over a fire, the chief of the sect then holding a burnt
stick before his eyes, and making him swear the sacred oath of the
society. There are several masonic signs by which a Kofung man may
be recognized. He frequently has a brass ring on his toe, thumb, or
wrist. One man may be recognized by a brother in the order if he
crosses his arms, or crosses two twigs. Every member is supposed to
have an attendant spirit who can be summoned, if required, by
uttering certain magical words and calling the spirit by name seven
times. Kofung men believe they can transform themselves into
animals. If, however, they are tied up to a piece of corkwood, they
believe they no longer possess this power.</p>

<p>As far as can be ascertained, the Kofung society is not
dangerous to the community. Murder does not appear to come within
its scope. It seems merely to teach a highly superstitious
doctrine, such as the mystery-loving pagan’s soul delights in. Even
when these people adopt Islam, they never seem wholly to give up
the mystic rites of their former pagan teachings. They certainly
never lose the superstitions of their particular tribe. In cases
where pagans have been converted to Christianity exactly the same
failings are almost invariably to be noticed.</p>

<p>Amongst many of these pagan tribes a curious superstition exists
with regard to the birth of twins in a family. The twins are killed
and the mother driven out into the bush, for twins are said to be a
curse from the god the people worship; it being supposed that if
the foregoing brutal procedure be not carried out the whole family
will become mad.</p>

<p>On the 17th of January I set out to cross the border into French
Guinea. Our road lay along small mountain-paths, more like goat
tracks than roads, which wound laboriously<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_46">[46]</span> up the precipitous, rocky slopes. The scenery
here is very wild and beautiful. As far as the eye can reach there
rise up a series of rugged peaks, clothed in light bush and tall
elephant-grass. Numerous mountain torrents rush down in their
headlong course to the plains of Sankaran, which can but faintly be
discerned many miles below in French Guinea.</p>

<p>Some of these tiny streams are destined to grow into important
if not mighty rivers; such a one is the Niger. To see this
insignificant rivulet, here only a few feet wide, as it dashes down
the eastern slopes of the Tembikunda Range, who would dream that it
is to develop into a wide, splendid waterway, destined to fertilize
large tracts of country in Western Soudan, and to carry innumerable
craft on its broad bosom before it finally throws its waters into
the sea 2400 miles away?</p>

<p>My hammock “boys” had a rough time carrying me over these
mountains. We climbed up to a height of 3000 feet, according to my
aneroid barometer, before commencing the descent to the plains
below. Once or twice, I must own, I felt as if my last hour had
come, when, having arrived at an unusually difficult place, my
satellites had to raise the hammock to the full extent of their
long black arms in order to clear some huge boulder blocking the
path. At these moments I used to gaze down at the yawning precipice
at my side, knowing that if one of those arms should waver, be it
ever so slightly, I should in all probability be hurled down some
2000 feet into the chasm below. Fortunately for me my bearers were
brawny fellows, and we arrived at the frontier village of Farakoro
without any mishap.</p>

<p>The good people of this little place were evidently not used to
visits from white men, and were much astonished at my sudden
appearance. The trade road between French Guinea and the east of
Sierra Leone is a considerable<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_47">[47]</span> distance north of this place, and goes to the
important station of Kaballa, which is the head-quarters of one of
the Sierra Leone District Commissioners. On my arrival at Farakoro
the inhabitants fled precipitately, and I found myself left in
undisputed possession of the village. I at once sent my servant
with reassuring messages to the chief, who had taken refuge in the
neighbouring bush with his followers. My escort was no longer with
me, for I had sent the soldiers back to Daru that morning. After
some palaver the old chief was induced to show himself, and finally
led his people back to the market-place, although it was palpable
that his suspicions of us were not quite set at rest.</p>

<p>I halted an hour here to give the carriers a little well-earned
repose, and, while they were resting, I thought I would try the
effect of a present of tobacco on my old friend the chief. It was
magical. No sooner had he got possession of this highly prized
article than his face became wreathed in smiles, all suspicions
either vanished or were forgotten, and we were on the best of
terms. The old man produced some bananas for myself and some rice
for my carriers, so that everyone was in the highest of spirits.
Food has a most remarkable effect on the negro. If his stomach is
well cared for he is a cheerful rascal, and will follow you almost
anywhere. Whether he wants it or not he is always ready to eat;
indeed, the amount consumed by a black man at one meal is something
prodigious. I recollect seeing one of these men devour his ration,
one and a half pounds of rice, which, when boiled, swells to a
considerable volume, and is itself more than a meal for two very
hungry Europeans. After this he bolted two large yams, which are
also a very satisfying form of diet, and finally he ended the meal
with a leg of goat! Strange to relate, after a few hours’ peaceful
slumber he appeared to be none the worse for his huge repast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
</p>

<p>The road now improved considerably, and two miles farther we
finally left the mountains, emerging into the broad Sankaran
plains. The change in scenery was really remarkable. Broad rice-
and maize-fields stretched on every side; in place of the wild,
rugged hills we were in a smiling land of peace and plenty.
Habitations were numerous, peasants were everywhere at work in the
well-cared-for farms, and one was at once struck by the general air
of prosperity. We soon came to a comparatively wide road, which we
followed to Sarafinian. The country was now decidedly open. Bush
there was, as there always is in West Africa, but it was all of the
nature of very low scrub and grass-land.</p>

<p>On my arrival at Sarafinian I was greeted by a French official,
who proved to be the Customs officer. At certain places along the
frontier of French Guinea there are Customs Stations established in
order to prevent smuggling of dutiable articles across the border.
In charge of these posts there are one or more Europeans. They are
provided with a small staff of native policemen who assist them to
carry out their duties. My friend had to supervise a section of
over sixty miles of frontier. The work is arduous and not
unattended by danger. Would-be smugglers naturally choose the night
for their dashes across the border, so a considerable portion of
the work has to be done after sunset. Even the best-behaved
smugglers are not men to hold human life of much account, so that
the task of capturing them is attended with a good deal of risk.
The existence must be a very lonely one. Situated as he was in a
desolate spot, thirty or forty miles from the nearest white man for
twelve months or more, and leading a life of some danger, it
requires a man endowed with particularly high spirits not to get
depressed at times. This French official was blessed with a large
share of his country’s native vivacity. He had been fourteen
months<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> by himself at
this little station, and during this long period had only seen one
white man; yet his good spirits never seemed to have failed him. He
welcomed me most warmly, and was kindness itself during my short
stay at Sarafinian.</p>

<p>I was glad of an opportunity of resting my leg here. The knee
was much swollen, being so painful I could not bear to put my foot
to the ground. For the first time I had a chance to get it well
dressed, and by the 19th it was so much better that I decided to
push on upon my journey northwards.</p>

<p>Here I paid off my Sierra Leone carriers, whose shining black
faces beamed with delight at receiving so much wealth all at once.
I think, too, that they were rather pleased to get back to their
native land. These people are generally eager for a job in their
own country, or even, perhaps, anywhere in the protectorate; but as
soon as they get into a foreign region, where food is different,
and the laws and customs are not the same, they begin to “fear,”
which, being translated into plain English, means that they are
nervous of what may happen to them.</p>

<p>My new gang of carriers were local natives. They were not in the
least anxious to be engaged, but the promise of high pay and the
glowing pictures painted by the Customs interpreter of the way they
could enjoy life on the proceeds thereof when they returned, were
effective in producing a sufficient number of stalwart porters for
my needs. The carrier in Sierra Leone is paid ninepence, but the
French Guinea carrier seldom gets more than sixpence per diem. My
offer of ninepence, therefore, was to these men a munificent one,
and the tempting bait of so much wealth was more than they could
resist. The chief of the town was present while the bargain was
being made, as it is the custom for all such dealings to be done
through the medium of the chief concerned. He was highly interested
in the question of the amount to be paid each man. In fact, so
eager was he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span> that I
am afraid he had in his mind some material gain for himself rather
than the welfare of his people. This chief was a strange, uncouth
individual.</p>

<p>His hair was very long and matted; he also wore his beard long,
but this was twisted in a miserable thin plait, hanging down below
his chest. He looked so dirty that it would have been necessary to
scrape him with a spade for some time before he could possibly be
washed; finally, he had an inordinate craving for absinthe, or any
kind of alcohol, and, according to my French acquaintance, he was
usually the worse for liquor. How he managed, in this remote little
place, to get so much European liquor was an amazing problem to
everyone. Few traders came that way; besides, absinthe and
such-like dainties are expensive luxuries in French Guinea, where
import duty is exceedingly high, and our worthy friend was a poor
man. This was apparently a secret known only to himself, and one he
would never disclose even when he was in his most confidential
moods. So the problem is, and appears likely to remain, unsolved.
Of course, there is also a great deal of native alcohol drunk by
the negro in West Africa. In all the districts within some 200
miles of the coast there is a broad belt of palm trees. These trees
produce a wine which, if allowed to ferment, is highly
intoxicating. The wine is obtained in the following manner. An
incision is made near the top of the tree, close to where the
leaves sprout; a calabash is then hung in such a position as to
catch the liquid as it flows out. At convenient times the owner
comes to remove the contents, which are a very cool and refreshing
beverage when not fermented.</p>

<p>The mode of climbing a palm tree is peculiar; it reminds one of
the proverbial monkey on a stick to see the native as he ascends a
tree. Ladders are not used for this purpose, but a loop is made
with a supple creeper and placed round<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_51">[51]</span> the trunk of the tree. The climber then seats
himself in the free end of the loop, placing his toes against the
bark of the palm. By digging his toes firmly into the tree-trunk he
is able to relieve the loop of his weight sufficiently to permit of
the loop being pushed further up the tree. In this manner the top
is gradually reached. Natives generally climb their trees to fetch
the wine in the early morning; the liquor is then left to ferment
in the sun till the evening. About sundown the men assemble in a
hut and drink the intoxicating stuff while squatting by the
fireside. Women as a rule do not drink; at any rate, I never
remember seeing a woman under the influence of palm-wine in the
bush.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving Sarafinian I crossed the Niger. It was here
about ten yards wide, and not more than three feet deep. The stream
at this stage is, of course, of no importance, but is of interest
purely on account of the greatness which is to be its portion
later. Between this spot and Faranah the stream is crossed three
times, gradually widening out as it has room to expand in the
comparatively flat Sankaran plains, till at Faranah it is about
seventy yards broad. It is fordable all the way, and until this
town is reached no canoes are seen on its waters. The banks are
lightly wooded, sloping easily down to the water’s edge. As the
little river meanders peacefully through the bush-country, it might
well be a trout stream in some quiet spot in England.</p>

<p>That day’s march was a long one, for I only reached camp at six
o’clock. The carriers were all behind my hammock, and some did not
get in till long after dark. About eight o’clock the headman
arrived with the pleasant news that two of the porters had thrown
the loads on the ground and bolted several miles back. As might
have been expected, these two loads were just the most important
ones of my caravan, one of which was my camp bed. I
immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span> ordered
two men to be despatched to retrieve them, inwardly praying that
they had not already been stolen by some rapacious negro on the
road. This habit of throwing down one’s belongings and running away
when they feel so disposed is a common one among West African
carriers, and is particularly annoying to their unlucky employer.
However, in that land one soon gets philosophical about such
trifles, and comes to the conclusion that life is too short to
permit of them being taken too much to heart. So, making the best
of affairs, I lay down on a blanket and soon was fast asleep.</p>

<p>The next morning, having enrolled two fresh men from the village
where I had slept, we were once more up to marching strength. The
sun was now getting decidedly hot; the country was undulating bush,
but fairly open. We had not gone many miles when dense clouds of
smoke and huge flames became visible on the horizon. It was evident
we were marching towards a bush fire. The heat grew more and more
intolerable as the wind drove the flames in our direction, and the
porters instinctively began to run forward in order to dash through
the burning zone as quickly as possible. It was the first time I
had actually marched through a large bush fire, although I had, of
course, often been close to a patch of burning bush-country.</p>

<p>In spite of the terrific heat, the spectacle was so splendid as
to make one oblivious of the discomfort. For miles in front of us
was a huge wall of leaping, hissing flames. Through the centre
there ran a narrow path from which the blazing fire seemed to have
been hurled back to the right and left, thus giving us a free
passage through the scorching bank of flames. The fire was
approaching with amazing rapidity. In front of it darted out many
terrified inhabitants of the bush, such as hares, field-mice, and
partridges, all wondering, no doubt, what was this infernal,
blazing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span> demon which
thus relentlessly drove them from their homes. While the ground was
covered with these poor frightened creatures, the air was full of
equally terrified insects, attempting to get out of danger before
their wings should be singed by those cruel flames. In many cases
their attempted flight only drove them into the clutches of their
arch-enemies the hawks, who, seemingly oblivious of the heat,
circled in the air above their luckless victims, every now and then
pouncing down on a tempting morsel.</p>

<p>Once we started running it did not take long to get to the other
side of the fire, for it sweeps forward with extraordinary speed,
burning up the grass and small bushes in a few seconds, leaving in
its wake only charred remains and here and there a tree or bush,
more tenacious of life than the others, still wrapped in a sheet of
flame while the fire is disappearing in the distance. Big trees are
often to be seen still blazing some days after the bush fire has
passed that way. After emerging from the flames we were all
begrimed with the soot and ashes; even the natives’ dusky faces
showed signs of having been through something blacker than the
colour of their skins.</p>

<p>The change which had now come over the surface of the landscape
was remarkable. In place of the waving bush, which had existed but
a few minutes before, there was now an open plain, almost devoid of
vegetation, carpeted with smouldering ashes. Under the heat of that
tropical sun one missed the grateful shade afforded by the bush,
and the perspiration rolled in big drops from the faces of the
carriers as they trudged stolidly on under the weight of their
loads.</p>

<p>On the 21st of January our bush path merged into the main road
which runs from Faranah to Kissidougou. This is a highway, fifteen
feet wide, and kept in good repair by the French. It was far
superior to any road I had yet come across, and made a very decided
difference to our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
rate of marching. There is one great drawback to these wide roads
in West Africa, viz. they are much hotter to march on, as there is
no shade available. But that is, after all, a minor disadvantage,
as the communications of a country are obviously greatly
facilitated. Here I saw the telegraph line for the first time since
leaving the Sierra Leone Railway. To a visitor in French West
Africa it soon becomes apparent that our continental neighbours
excel in the matter of public works in their colonies. Roads,
railways, bridges and telegraphs have the most careful attention,
and a vast amount of money is spent on their construction.</p>

<p>That night I camped at the village of Kamaraia. The inhabitants
are an offshoot of the Korankos of Sierra Leone, and are similar to
them in their habits; but as the country is more fertile they are
more prosperous. The evening was beguiled by some native music. The
musician played an instrument called “Ballaini.” It produces a
melodious and rather liquid sound, and was one of the most musical
native instruments I heard. It is made of a gourd, partially
covered over with goatskin, and has narrow cross-pieces of bamboo
nailed over it. The musician produces the different notes by
hitting these cross-pieces with a small stick. Most natives have a
good ear for music, but their repertoire of melodies is extremely
small. A man will be quite happy, however, in sitting the whole
evening repeating the same bars over and over again to an admiring
audience. I regret to say that I was not so easily amused, and
after half an hour had to tell our friend to finish his performance
elsewhere.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="chap_sum">Faranah — The Malinkés — Castes — Big game on
the Mafou River — Native methods of hunting — Trapping — Ground
nuts — The native trader — Kouroussa — Native types — French
gardens — Native dances — Beehives — Fruit.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">BY the 22nd of January, the date of our arrival
at Faranah, I had so far recovered as to be able to walk a few
miles each day. My usual plan was to walk in the early morning
until the sun got oppressive, when I retired to the hammock until
about eleven. About this hour I used to halt in a shady spot, by a
stream, and have my breakfast while the carriers cooked their food
and rested. A halt till two or three o’clock gave my “boy” time to
prepare my meal and to have his own food and a rest before we again
set out. On one of these occasions, just after I had halted, I
noticed the unusual spectacle of two Europeans in hammocks with a
number of carriers coming towards me. One of the two proved to be a
lady, while the other was her husband. They stopped, and we had a
few minutes’ conversation. They were on their way to Kissidougou, a
large French post in the south of Guinea. He was the director of
the telegraphs, and they had but lately arrived from France. The
lady had the characteristic vivacity and charm of her countrywomen;
she was nursing a young bushfowl which they had picked up on the
road, and which had hurt its leg. The poor little bird’s bright
eyes wore a terrified look, but this soon began to disappear under
the gentle treatment of its kind mistress. The lady had never been
out of her native land<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_56">[56]</span> previously, and was much interested in the
strange sights of West African bush life.</p>

<p>Faranah is the first place of any size and importance on the
Niger. It consists of a native population of about 2000, and a
dozen Frenchmen. The native town lies in a hollow, close to the
banks of the river, while the Residency and European quarter are on
a hill above. Faranah does a small trade in rubber and cattle, most
of which are sent down to the coast port of Konakry. There is a
caravanserai, or rest-house, in the town. This useful construction
is found in nearly every village of any size in French Guinea, and
is a great boon to the traveller. The headman of the place is
charged with the duty of keeping it clean, and as it is constantly
inspected by a French official, the house is usually in the best of
order. The houses at Faranah are built of mud, with walls about two
feet thick, and thatched roofs. They are very cool in the hot
weather, but are rather cold and draughty in the rainy season, when
it is a good plan to light a fire in the middle of your room.</p>

<p>At Faranah I stayed with the French District Commissioner, who
was a most hospitable and courteous host. Here I was delighted to
be able to discard my hammock, as my knee was nearly healed. A two
days’ halt was necessary to collect fresh carriers, and to get
information of the shooting prospects in front of me.</p>

<p>My intention had been to march as rapidly as possible to
Kouroussa, and strike eastward from that place into the Wasulu
country, which lies between the Niger and the Ivory Coast. At
Faranah, however, I was informed that there was some excellent
shooting to be had on the Mafou River, a tributary of the Niger,
which is crossed on the road to Kouroussa. I therefore determined
to halt at this stream on my way, and sample the big-game shooting
in the vicinity.</p>

<p>On the 24th, bidding good-bye to my kind hosts, I
set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span> out. The road
follows within a few miles of the Niger, which here takes a
north-easterly course. The country is rather thick bush, but is
well populated. Villages occur every three or four miles most of
the way. The people who inhabit this part of French Guinea are
Malinkés, and they are dark of complexion and stoutly built. They
are a higher type than the coast negro, having probably
intermarried with the Fulanis, to whom they no doubt owe their more
regular features and thinner lips. They are chiefly an agricultural
people, but are not fond of work in any form. The majority of them
are Mussulmans.</p>

<p>The king of the tribe is called the “Alimamy.” He has a large
court, chiefly composed of his relations, who all expect to profit,
either directly or indirectly, by their position. They are the
channel of communication between him and his people. His council is
composed of the headmen of the villages, and rich native traders.
The council decides all matters of dispute with other tribes. The
decision for making peace or war rests with them, and, in the event
of the king’s death it is this body who elects the new Alimamy.</p>

<p>Villages are organized on the same lines, each village having a
chief, assisted by his council of influential villagers. The tribe
is divided into two portions, those who are free, and those who are
captives.</p>

<p>The free portion of each tribe is again divided into five
castes:</p>

<p>(1) The Horos, who are citizens.</p>

<p>(2) The Sohrés, weavers.</p>

<p>(3) The Garangis, or shoemakers.</p>

<p>(4) The Hrabis, or blacksmiths.</p>

<p>(5) The Yellimanis, or jesters.</p>

<p>The Horos are the only class from which chiefs and headmen can
be selected. They are the predominant caste, and all the others are
their menials.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
</p>

<p>Horos can only marry in their own class. The other people can
marry amongst themselves as they please.</p>

<p>The Hrabis are looked on with great contempt, corresponding in
caste to the sweeper class of India. It is uncertain what was the
origin of this, but there is a story connected with Mohammed and a
blacksmith which probably accounts for it. It is said that the
Prophet was once pursued by some infidels, and concealed himself in
the trunk of a tree near the spot where a blacksmith was at work.
The latter was on the point of betraying Mohammed’s hiding-place
when he was struck blind by God. Mohammed, when he issued from the
tree, is supposed to have cursed the blacksmith and all his
kind.</p>

<p>The Yellimanis are a very obnoxious class. They spend their time
in abusing those who do not give them any money, while they sing
the praises of their patrons. Every chief has an entourage of these
jesters. They are often equipped with musical instruments, and form
a sort of band which precedes him wherever he goes.</p>

<p>Families have always some animal which is their particular
aversion, or evil spirit. It may be a lion, or leopard, or
crocodile, or some such beast. For example, it is supposed that if
a man’s evil genius was a crocodile, and he should eat some of this
animal’s flesh, it would give him some terrible skin disease, such
as leprosy.</p>

<p>The captives, or slaves, are of course not now officially
recognized by the French. Any man who is a slave can at once obtain
his freedom by applying to the nearest Commissioner. It shows how
contented these captives usually are with their lot, when it is
noticed that they very rarely ask to be made free. They are well
treated, are not hard worked, and get free board and lodging. These
slaves were taken from various tribes during the intertribal
warfare which raged in this part of West Africa for many years. In
most cases these people have quite forgotten<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_59">[59]</span> the country of their origin, and are
perfectly content to remain with their masters. A slave, when he
has gained his freedom, can be permitted to join any of the
above-mentioned castes, or may marry into any of them. His position
is therefore superior to that of a Hrabi. The captive lives with
the members of the family, and is in every way treated as one of
them.</p>

<p>On the 26th of January I arrived at the Mafou River, where I had
great hopes of getting some elephant. These animals were reported
by the natives to come down here at this time of year. On the river
there was a certain palm of which they were very fond. Native
information is, of course, frequently the only kind available, but
it is also far from reliable. The negro, when interrogated, will
give the answer that comes easiest to him, and will usually say
what he thinks will most please you. So I was far from placing too
much faith in their reports. Having procured two native hunters, I
sent them out to get news of the whereabouts of the elephant, and
in the meantime decided to try my luck with a third hunter after
waterbuck and kob, of which I had seen traces in the neighbourhood.
The banks of the Mafou River are swampy and the ideal home of
kob.</p>

<p>Here I managed to secure a fine beast, with the best head I had
yet shot in West Africa. Pleased with my day’s sport I returned to
my camp at the village that afternoon, hoping to get some good news
from my hunters. I was therefore much disappointed to be told that
the elephant had not been seen in that district for some weeks, and
the tracks seen by the hunters were at least a month old. I had
myself that morning seen elephant tracks, close to a place where
they had evidently been in the habit of bathing in the Mafou River.
These tracks were likewise some weeks old. As there seemed no
prospect of elephant in the neighbourhood, I decided to follow
my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span> original plan of
pushing on with as little delay as possible to the Wasulu
country.</p>

<p>The next day I continued my journey to Kouroussa. It was always
my custom to set out in the morning, just before daylight, and to
have a start of about half an hour on my carriers. In this way one
often got a chance of a shot at game while it was feeding within
range of the bush path, and had not been disturbed by passers-by. I
used to wear boots with noiseless soles, finding this a good plan
for enabling me to approach without being heard. A bush path is a
very sinuous affair as a rule, and it frequently happens that one
suddenly turns a corner and comes in sight of game, quite as
unaware of the proximity of man as you are of its presence. One
morning, while walking thus ahead of my carriers, I suddenly espied
a small duiker dart across the road, and was fortunate enough to
get a snapshot at it before it disappeared into the bush. It proved
to be a “crowned duiker,” a beautiful little animal, only fifteen
inches high. This small antelope is of a bright yellowish fawn
colour, with remarkably long and pointed ears. The tail was short
and blackish, more like the tail of most oribis. The horns were
very small and delicate, but this little beast is uncommon, so my
delight at securing it was great; moreover, I had never before seen
it wild. The habit of all duikers is to conceal themselves in the
bush, consequently one does not often see them unless a drive is
organized, and this to me always appears rather an unsportsmanlike
procedure.</p>

<p>This little antelope derives its name “crowned” from the dainty
crownlike tuft on the top of its head. The duiker probably falls a
victim, more than any other kind of antelope, to the native hunter.
His method of killing game is distinctly brutal. When the bush is
ready to be burnt, a number of hunters collect together and proceed
with the boys of the village to the scene selected for
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span> sport. The
hunters line up at a suitable place, on a path, down-wind. The boys
are sent to drive the game in the direction of this path out of the
bush. Their procedure is as follows: each person being equipped
with a tomtom, an old tin, or some similar article capable of
producing a noise, sets to work to make a tremendous din. At the
same time the grass is set on fire. The unfortunate animals in the
bush, scared out of their senses, dash the only way open to them,
viz. towards the path on which are the hunters. As they appear, at
a range of a dozen yards or less, they are received with a volley
of scraps of old metal, iron nails and sharp stones, fired from the
flint-lock guns of the sportsmen. The din is deafening, missiles
are flying in all directions, and the carnage amongst the luckless
little beasts is great. At the same time the shooting is decidedly
wild, and it is a matter of congratulation that this is the case,
for the slaughter is not so terrible as it would otherwise be. It
is a marvel that these people do not often kill one another by
their wild shooting. It is true occasionally a maimed native is
seen who admits that he has been crippled in this manner, but on
the whole the casualties are not so large as might be expected.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw3" id="i04"><img src="images/i04.jpg" alt=
"">
<div>
<p class="sc">Baro Village in the Kouroussa District of French
Guinea</p>

<p class="justify">The people of this district suffered very
severely in the Sofa wars. King Samory spread fire and sword
throughout the land, and carried off many of the people into
slavery. The inhabitants of Baro have only returned and rebuilt
their houses in recent years. They have the downtrodden,
low-spirited nature of men who have lived many years in
captivity.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another favourite method of killing game is by trapping it. The
ordinary form of trap is a long barricade of sticks and palm
leaves, built up to a height of several feet. At intervals in this
hedge there are narrow openings, with a running noose cunningly
concealed on the far side. A drive is organized and the animals are
frightened through the bush in the direction of this barricade. On
finding the openings they naturally endeavour to escape by them,
but are caught by the noose as they struggle through. Traps of this
nature are set for birds, as well as other small game. These
barricades are frequently built as much as a mile long. Yet another
form of trap I have often met with is simply a pit, dug to a depth
of six or seven feet, at the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_62">[62]</span> bottom of which is planted a stake, having
the sharpened end sticking vertically upwards, ready to impale the
unfortunate animal which falls upon it.</p>

<p>The pits are usually covered over with leaves, and are thus
invisible to the unsuspecting victim. These snares are often as
dangerous to strangers as to game, on account of this invisibility,
and it is dangerous to wander in the bush of a hunting country
without a local guide. On one occasion one of my porters strayed
away from camp after dark. In the morning he was not forthcoming to
carry his load when all was ready for the start. A comrade suddenly
recollected that he had gone towards the bush the previous night,
and it transpired that he had not since been seen. Search parties
were at once organized and despatched in search of him. After some
time they returned with a very pitiable-looking object, whose
clothes were torn, and whose nether garments were smeared in blood.
This proved to be the lost carrier. He had fallen into a hunter’s
pit some distance from camp, and all his cries for help had not
been heard. Fortunately he was more frightened than hurt, and
certainly profited by his experience, for he never wandered into
strange bush again!</p>

<p>We had now left the belt of oil-palm country behind. The chief
product of this district was rubber. The rubber is here the product
of the rubber vine, and is seen in some quantities growing in the
bush. But the majority of the rubber of French Guinea is grown in
the east of the colony.</p>

<p>In the farms one notices particularly rice, maize and ground
nuts. The latter is a pretty little plant with a small yellow
flower. The nuts themselves grow on the roots in the ground,
something after the fashion of a potato. The fruit is ripe after
the plant has flowered. On one plant will be found as many as fifty
nuts. They are much relished as a form of diet by the native, while
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span> oil of the nut is
a valuable thin oil, much used in Europe for making fine soaps,
scents, and as a dressing similar to salad oil.</p>

<p>In the bush it is of the greatest use as a lamp oil, but must
first be purified by straining through a thin cloth. For about
three months I used nothing else, and found the light as good as
that of a kerosene lamp.</p>

<p>The trader one encounters in the bush is the native trader,
called the “Dioula.” The European trader is only met with on the
coast, or in the biggest markets of the interior. The term Dioula
merits a word of explanation. These people are supposed to have
originally been wandering Mohammedan merchants, but now the term
applies to any travelling trader. The Dioula is a very thrifty
individual, usually commencing life in a most humble way. He
probably leaves his village with only a few francs in his pocket,
which he exchanges at a suitable opportunity for some article of
commerce, such as salt. He then travels a bit nearer to the coast,
exchanging his salt for rubber or perhaps ground nuts. This process
he continues, constantly bartering one article for another, until
he finally reaches the coast. Here he purchases cloth, or some such
European goods, and works his way back to the interior, bartering
as he goes. These traders often accumulate quite big fortunes by
their keen business instincts.</p>

<p>Kouroussa lies on a bare open plateau, overlooking the Niger. It
is the centre of the district of the same name, and is increasing
in size and importance daily. The cause of its growth is the Guinea
Railway, emanating from the coast port of Konakry, and destined to
reach Kouroussa in a very short time. The total length of this line
will be about 400 miles. The object of the railway is to tap the
trade of the Futa Jallon region, and the fertile country on the
banks of the Niger. As the Niger is more or less navigable from
Kouroussa for canoes and quite small<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_64">[64]</span> lighters, this will also open out a line of
communication from the interior of the Soudan and French Guinea to
the coast.</p>

<p>When I arrived at Kouroussa I went to pay my respects to the
Commissioner. I found him contemplating a ruined building with a
rueful eye. It was all that remained of his house. When I had
introduced myself to him he proceeded to explain that the previous
night his house had been burnt to the ground. The act was
attributed to the spite of a native, who had been punished by him
for some misdemeanour. Unfortunately it was difficult to collect
proof against the man, and it appeared as if he would escape from
the hands of justice. The people of this town are a strange mixture
of several tribes. At or near this point three great races meet—the
Susus, from South-Western Guinea, the Malinkés, from the south of
the colony, and the Fulanis, from Futa Jallon, in the west. The
consequence is that a hybrid race formed by the intermarriage of
these different clans has sprung up. The natives are perhaps a
higher class than the ordinary negro of Guinea. They inherit from
the Fulanis a finer type of features, thinner lips and more
aquiline noses. Their hair, however, remains woolly, and stamps
them as undoubtedly negroid. They are chiefly agriculturists. Some,
however, are cattle-men, owning considerable herds. They are
distinctly lazy; this, perhaps, is hardly to be wondered at, as
their country is fruitful and it needs but little work to get a
living out of the soil. Besides, a man need only gather a small
quantity of rubber in the bush to gain a livelihood.</p>

<p>At Kouroussa the French officials have a fine garden. Almost
every kind of European vegetable is grown by them. The garden is
personally supervised by one of the officers, who has a large
number of native gardeners under his orders. From one year’s end to
another they are never<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_65">[65]</span> without some sort of vegetables. The garden
is planted on the banks of the Niger, so that a constant supply of
water is available. There is also a well-stocked fruit plantation,
where one can enjoy a variety of tropical fruits such as oranges,
pomegranates, bananas, etc. The French show a particular aptitude
for gardening, and it was a point which struck me very forcibly
that in almost every station where there was a European, a good
garden would be found. On one evening of my stay at Kouroussa I
witnessed the interesting and rather weird spectacle of a native
dance. This particular dance was performed by some young girls, to
the accompaniment of much tomtoming and cheering from the assembled
throng of admiring onlookers.</p>

<p>These girls were dressed in short skirts, much resembling a
ballet-dancer’s skirt, but made out of a sort of bulrush very
common in these parts. The bodice was a brightly coloured native
cloth, twisted gracefully round the breast and waist. On the head
was worn a bonnet of plumes of various hues. We were escorted to
the place of honour by the side of the chief, who then clapped his
hands as a sign for the performance to commence. The spectators
were thronged in a circle round him, many being provided with
tomtoms and musical instruments of all descriptions.</p>

<p>At the given signal the dancers dashed into the ring, joining
hands and advancing with a graceful swinging step towards the
chief, the tomtoms all this time playing a slow measure. The music
gradually became faster and faster, while the dancers increased
their pace in unison with it. Turning and twisting their lithe
bodies, they now retired, at every step the music waxing faster and
their pace becoming more frenzied. This performance was repeated
many times, until the pace was so rapid and the dancers had got so
exhausted as to no longer be able to keep time with the music. At
this moment they flung themselves on the ground before the chief
and the tomtoms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
simultaneously ceased beating. It appeared evident that it was now
we were expected to show our appreciation of the skill of the
dancing-girls, so we rewarded each one with a small coin, after
which they retired. Similar dances were executed by individual
girls; in several cases they displayed remarkable agility and grace
in their movements. The spectators were untiring in their tomtoming
and applause, and it was evident that this dance was a most popular
one.</p>

<p>Dancing is a very favourite amusement among West African
natives. Every tribe has its special dances, some of which are far
from graceful according to our ideas. There is, however, an
undeniable fascination in seeing these weird black figures leaping
and pirouetting in their picturesque costumes, with the strange
glow of the firelight casting mysterious shadows on them as they
move backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of Kouroussa the natives keep a number of
beehives. These hives are frequently seen stuck up in high trees.
They are made out of reeds bound in the form of a hollow cylinder,
having the ends closed with plastered mud. One of these mud doors
has a hole in the centre, providing an entrance and exit for the
bees. The negro has a great liking for sweet things, so a quantity
of this honey is consumed. Before it can be eaten by the European
it must be strained through a piece of muslin, as it is exceedingly
dirty. When properly cleaned, however, it is excellent.</p>

<p>Wild fruit is scarce, and in any case should be partaken of with
great caution, as there are several poisonous varieties. There is a
kind of wild plum which is fairly common in this part of French
Guinea and has a pleasant flavour. Occasionally wild bananas and
pawpaws are met with; they almost invariably indicate the site of
an old, abandoned village.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="chap_sum">Samory and the Sofas — The Sofa wars —
Desertion of my “boy” — Kouroussa and Kankan — Native horses — An
inhospitable reception — Kankan — Trade at Kankan — The rubber vine
— Native telegraphy — Personal adornment.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MENTION has several times been made of King
Samory and his Sofas. Kouroussa was for some time the centre of his
plundering operations; it will therefore be advisable to give some
account of this enlightened chief’s history before describing his
doings in that country.</p>

<p>Samory came from the neighbourhood of Bobodjilassu, an important
town between the north of the “Gold Coast Northern Territories” and
the Niger. He was a Mohammedan, and became a very influential chief
on account of his strong personality.</p>

<p>He collected an army of between 30,000 and 40,000 men, and
ravaged practically the whole of what is the colony of French
Guinea, as well as a portion of the French Soudan and Sierra Leone
Protectorate. His troops were first composed of Mandingoes from the
Middle Niger, but gradually as he advanced he absorbed large
numbers of other tribes whom he had subjugated, and the whole army
was designated by the name of Sofas. For fifteen years he spread
terror throughout the land, on several occasions even inflicting
severe reverses on the French troops he encountered. He was finally
captured by the French in 1897, and died in captivity three years
later. His army was too large to be concentrated for any time, so
had to disperse to obtain<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_68">[68]</span> supplies. This resulted in wholesale plunder
and wanton devastation of the land. The natives hated the Sofas,
who pillaged their homes and carried off their wives without any
mercy.</p>

<p>Large districts were depopulated by their ravages; indeed, to
this day the ruins of villages, which were abandoned during the
Sofa wars, are frequently seen in the bush. It is only during the
last few years that this part of West Africa has begun to settle
down peacefully after the long period of plunder and wholesale
murder which existed during the reign of King Samory.</p>

<p>A further cause of this prolonged warfare at this time was that
when the Sofa lieutenants were not employing their soldiers on
behalf of Samory, they were in the habit of letting their services
out to anybody who was willing to pay for them. This system
naturally led to a number of local small wars, thus further
aggravating the harm done by Samory and his followers.</p>

<p>This chief was certainly the biggest native general ever
encountered by European troops in West Africa. Many of his soldiers
afterwards enlisted in British and French colonial corps, and
proved themselves excellent fighting material.</p>

<p>In Kouroussa market-place there is a large baobab tree, under
which Samory used to hold court. Here he used to try his prisoners,
and here they used to be executed. That tree must have seen some
horrible sights in its day. What tales it could tell of murder and
injustice committed under its shady boughs! Baobab trees are common
in these parts; nearly every village possesses one, and it is under
these spreading branches that the chief and his followers are wont
to sit and gossip during the heat of the day.</p>

<p>One of my carriers about this time was an oldish man, who had
been a young warrior in Samory’s army. He used to relate some
blood-curdling stories over the camp<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_69">[69]</span> fire at night of the atrocities committed by
that chief. The carrier had himself, it appeared, been a
participator in some cruel acts. On one occasion he was sent with a
party to exact tribute from a refractory town, with orders to
inform the people they would be plundered and their town burnt
unless they complied. He described with a great show of pride how
he first extorted twice the required sum, and then proceeded to
massacre the unfortunate, helpless inhabitants. Little wonder that
Samory’s soldiery was feared and mistrusted in those days of
plunder and bloodshed.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 31st I had given my “boy” particular
orders to call me early, in order to start on my way to Kankan.
About five o’clock I woke, and could see no signs of my servant.
This surprised me, as he was usually very punctual. I called, but
receiving no reply, went out to investigate the cause of his
non-appearance. On entering the kitchen it became evident that he
had run away, for all his personal property had been removed. I
never saw him again, and can only conclude that he had found the
journey rather harder work than he had bargained for, and had
decided to return to his native land before it was too late.</p>

<p>This incident was extremely annoying just as I was about to
start for my shooting-ground, and I was much afraid it would be
impossible to get a “boy” suited to my requirements in the place.
Fortune, however, favoured me, and the District Commissioner
assured me he would be able to procure a cook who could speak
French and Bambara in a few hours. I decided to march off, on the
understanding that the “boy” would follow and meet me that evening
in camp. True to his promises, the Commissioner sent me the
servant, who remained with me until I reached Timbuctu. His name
was Mamadu; he had many faults and was hardly the sort of “boy” I
should have chosen, but I was<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_70">[70]</span> lucky to get one at all, and after all he
possessed one or two good qualities, and could bake bread better
than any native servant I had yet had.</p>

<p>Mamadu’s chief fault was his irrepressible tongue. I made many
efforts, both by gentle and strong means, to curb this bad habit
while he was with me, but have to acknowledge complete failure.
Incessant chatter is a failing of most negro tribes, but I never
met such an inveterate talker as Mamadu before, nor am I likely to
do so again. At night he would be talking when one wanted to go to
sleep, and in the early morning I was generally wakened by his
unceasing chatter. When he slept and what he had to talk about were
two problems I never succeeded in solving.</p>

<p>At Kouroussa the Niger is about 250 yards wide, and here there
is a canoe ferry to the point on the opposite shore where the
Kankan road commences. As I mentioned before, the Niger is
partially navigable from here to Bamako, a distance of about 200
miles. Navigation is frequently interrupted by sandbanks, which are
fairly common in this part of the stream. At such places canoes
have to be unloaded, and the contents carried to the other side of
the obstruction, where fresh canoes are in waiting— a somewhat
tedious and slow process.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable scarcity of waterfowl on the Niger above
Bamako. I do not recollect seeing a single duck or goose on this
section of the river, although occasionally I saw a few teal. It is
true that the river was rather dry at this time, but I was informed
by French officials that it was very unusual to find duck at any
time of year in the upper reaches of the Niger.</p>

<p>The country between Kouroussa and Kankan consists of rather
thick bush, except for a stretch of more open grass-land between
the Niger and its tributary the Niandan. Rice is rather scarce in
this region. The native<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_71">[71]</span> lives principally on sweet potatoes and
cassada. The Niandan is a stream of no great size, but with a very
rapid current. It is not too deep to be fordable, but the swiftness
of the current makes it dangerous to try the experiment. It was
here that I first saw horses in any numbers during my journey, so
we were evidently out of the tsetse fly belt, which is so fatal to
these animals. An old chief rode up to the stream as we arrived,
mounted on a horse with gay trappings, and his toes thrust into the
curious, heavy iron stirrups always used in West Africa. The
saddles are made of wood, with a high back, and are extremely hard,
although not otherwise uncomfortable. The wickedest part of the
saddlery is the bit. This is made of rough iron, having a ring
through which the animal’s tongue is thrust, and a cruel spike so
fashioned as to stab the roof of the horse’s mouth each time the
reins are pulled; the inevitable consequence being that a horse’s
mouth is almost always spoilt when he is young, and is usually in a
lacerated condition. Malinkés are good riders, but atrocious
horsemasters. Horses are generally ridden too young, frequently
getting their backs strained from this cause. Animals here average
about thirteen hands or less, and it is seldom that a good beast is
seen, owing to the system of inbreeding which prevails.</p>

<p>The horses in this part of the country are not bred locally, but
are imported from the south of French Soudan. Indeed, I much doubt
if horses are ever bred in French Guinea, or anyhow in the eastern
half of the colony.</p>

<p>The native’s chief delight is to gallop. He will often be seen
careering along at racing speed, for no reason whatever except that
he appears to think that the horse is only born to carry him at the
top of its pace. These people are very fond of horse-races. Here,
too, their one idea is to gallop hard the whole distance. Their
knowledge of the staying powers of their animals seems to be
strangely lacking. The<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_72">[72]</span> result is that their horses finish at a
snail’s pace and are quite exhausted. Besides, horses are generally
grass-fed, and consequently very soft. In spite of all the bad
treatment he suffers from, the native pony is frequently a hardy
little animal, capable of doing a long day’s work, making one
wonder what he might not be able to do if breeding were carefully
attended to and the animals were well looked after.</p>

<p>I had no difficulty all this time in keeping the larder well
supplied with birds, while an occasional buck brought joy to the
carriers’ hearts. Bush-fowl and guinea fowl were sufficiently
numerous in the farms on the roadside to provide for my wants. The
day of my arrival at Kankan I had started in the morning, as was my
custom, before the carriers, with my shot-gun on my shoulder,
intending to do a little shooting on the way. Having secured all I
wanted, I pressed on to the town, accompanied by one man to carry
the birds. I have no doubt I looked an extremely uncouth and grimy
figure, for I had been walking for some hours, and the road was hot
and dusty. My costume, too, no doubt looked strange, consisting as
it did of khaki shooting-breeches cut short at the knee and a rough
khaki flannel shirt, open at the collar, with the sleeves rolled up
to the elbow. In spite of my curious appearance, however, I was
much amazed to be mistaken for a villain intent on taking the life
of the French Commissioner! Yet such was the case.</p>

<p>On approaching the European quarter I observed a native
policeman, whom I asked to direct me to the Commissioner’s house.
This individual, to my surprise, immediately seized me and
attempted to wrench the gun out of my hand. It was with difficulty
that I restrained my anger in time to prevent myself striking him,
so sudden and unexpected was the onslaught. Fortunately at this
moment the Commissioner, hearing the commotion, came<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span> out of his office, and matters
were satisfactorily explained. It appeared that some time
previously a native who bore a grudge against the Commissioner had
attempted to shoot him, hence the policeman had been on the alert
in case of another attempt. My black friend, in the zeal of
performing his duty, had jumped to the conclusion that I was a
would-be assassin, and had lost no time in trying to deprive me of
my gun in consequence. I was much sunburnt at that time, and it is
possible that I looked to his excited imagination almost as dark as
his coloured brethren! That evening I dined with the official and
his wife, and we laughed heartily over the dramatic nature of my
arrival into Kankan.</p>

<p>I was rather surprised to find a French lady so far from the
haunts of civilization, but was informed that there were two more
ladies, the wives of French traders, in the town. The traveller in
the bush cannot but be struck with the refinement brought by a
woman’s presence to a lonely West African station. Colonials
necessarily grow rough in their habits when removed from the gentle
influence of woman’s society. In her presence the roughest of
mankind feels softened, and his better nature seems brought to the
front.</p>

<p>Kankan is a large town of 12,000 inhabitants. It owes its
importance to its position in the centre of the rubber-growing
district of Guinea. Moreover, before the appearance of the white
man and the consequent development of the rubber trade, Kankan had
for many years been a large native market. Probably the reason of
this is that it lies on the Milo River, one of the few tributaries
on this bank of the Niger which are navigable to any extent. From
Kankan the French traders are enabled, by using this stream, to
send boats with produce direct either to Bamako or Kouroussa.</p>

<p>There are no less than fourteen French trading firms<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span> established at this place. Their
chief business is, of course, done in rubber. In addition to
rubber, a large quantity of ground nuts, rice, millet and gum copal
pass through this large market, while Moors from the north of the
Senegal River, and Fulanis from the Middle Niger, bring herds of
cattle for sale to the town. It is indeed an amusing sight to
wander through the market-place in the morning, when it is crowded
with a cosmopolitan collection of coloured races. People of every
shade of colour will be seen. There is the negro from the coast,
with a face almost as black as coal, jostling against the
reddish-complexioned Fulanis and the pale-coloured Moors, while men
and women of every intermediate hue are also to be seen. The babel
of voices in many different tongues is most remarkable, and the
French traders used to tell me that they require interpreters in
about half a dozen different languages in their stores, for so
varied is the speech of their customers.</p>

<p>At Kankan I saw for the first time those curious bars of salt
transported from the desert salt-mines of the Sahara. They are
brought many hundreds of miles for sale in the interior of Guinea,
where salt is an article of considerable value. These bars weigh
fifty to sixty pounds, and are here sold for as much as thirty
francs. In the district of Kankan nearly every native is employed
collecting rubber in the bush, which he brings to the French
merchants for sale. The rubber vine grows in extraordinary
profusion to the north and east of the district. On the latter side
its range extends into the north of the Ivory Coast Colony. The
vine should not be tapped before it is four years old, when the
plant is about as thick as a man’s wrist. Unless it is cut in a
spiral fashion the plant will be killed. Much harm was done to the
rubber trade by the natives a few years ago by the wasteful manner
in which they tapped the vines. They used to make deep, circular
gashes completely round them, as by this means they were able to
get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span> the sap out more
easily, quite heedless of the fact that by so doing they were
killing the plants. Strict legislation has now been introduced to
prevent this wasteful and wanton destruction. When I first saw men
tapping rubber vines I was surprised to notice they invariably
rubbed the place where the incision was made with some
dirty-looking liquid. I was informed that this liquid was lime
juice and water, the object being to cause the rubber to
agglomerate as it exuded from the incision.</p>

<p class="sc">Native Types at Kankan</p>

<p class="justify">This place is a big rubber market of French
Guinea. Rubber commands a good price, so most of the natives are
well-to-do, as may be judged by their prosperous appearance. The
country east of Kankan is prolific in rubber vines, and the labour
entailed in tapping the vine is very small.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Rubber is collected in balls, which have a dirty greyish
appearance, and it is in this form that it is sold to the
merchants. To increase the weight of these balls it is a common
practice for the wily natives to mix water with the rubber, or to
place mud or some heavy substance in the interior. These tricks are
now becoming well known to the European trader, who is not often
deceived by them, although, when the ruse was first started, I
understand it met with considerable success. It is probable that a
large portion of French Guinea will be entirely devoted to the
rubber trade in the future, for it is mostly a rather scrubby
bush-country eminently suited to this particular commerce. Owing to
the large and increasing demand for rubber at the present time,
Guinea rubber, which is of good quality, commands a high price in
France.</p>

<p>At Kankan I had to change my carriers, and here I arranged to
send all the kit which I did not require on to Bamako, while only
taking a month’s stores, my rifles and camp equipment, on my
shooting trip into Wasulu country. After an interview with one of
the French trading firms, it was settled that my surplus baggage
should be forwarded in their lighters by river to Bamako, where I
would find it on my arrival at that place.</p>

<p>My carriers were now reduced to eight, and with this small party
I set out on the 3rd of February. For the first few miles the road
was the main route to the gold-mining<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_76">[76]</span> district of Siguiri, a fine, broad highway
which joins Kankan to the town of that name, a distance of sixty
miles. After leaving this road we turned into a small bush path,
striking nearly due east into the heart of the Wasulu country. At
Niansumana the Milo River is crossed. It is a stream about 100
yards wide, which we found fordable at this season. That evening I
observed a big drum in the chief’s compound, and thinking it might
be of some service to me, I inquired whether the village would send
word of my approach to the town of Falama, and ask if the hunters I
required were ready. The chief readily acquiesced, stating that
within an hour the people of Falama would have knowledge of the
message. Falama was nearly fifty miles from Niansumana, so that I
was anxious to see if the experiment would really be successful. In
less than three hours a reply had come from the hunters to say they
were ready awaiting me.</p>

<p>These drums are much used for signalling in this part of the
country, and without doubt account for the rapidity with which news
becomes known at a considerable distance from the spot where it
originates. The drums are made of a rough piece of log hollowed
out, often as much as four feet long, with the ends covered with
goat’s skin stretched taut. The drummer beats on the end with a
couple of sticks, or with his hands. It is wonderful how skilled
they are about sending quite long messages in this way. Of course,
every native does not understand the drum language. An expert ear
is necessary to send as well as to read a message. When war is
declared the inhabitants of the surrounding villages are all made
aware of the news by a drum message. In fact, when rapidity is an
object, the natives prefer to send their messages this way rather
than by messenger. The drum is in common use in many West African
countries. It is frequently used to call the people together for a
palaver, and can be heard<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_77">[77]</span> by men working in the most distant farms, who
at once obey the signal, leaving their crops to return to the
town.</p>

<p>We were now getting into a more open country watered by numerous
streams, most of which flowed north-west into the Niger. Villages
were becoming scarcer, and it was evident that the country was more
thinly populated. I was careful at each village I passed to make
inquiries for game, but it appeared that the game country hardly
started before the Sankarani River, which I should cross before
arriving at Falama. Cattle were far more numerous here than I had
yet seen them. The milk was exceedingly rich, and I was always
supplied with a large bowl of it on camping near a village. The
people were mostly cattle-men, and were a fine stalwart race. The
men must average five feet ten inches. The women are considerably
smaller. The latter go in for a great deal of personal adornment.
Their hair is dressed in small ringlets, screwed up tightly to the
side of the head, giving them a decidedly comical appearance, and
hardly enhancing their rather doubtful claims to good looks. The
wealthier women wear a large amount of cheap jewellery. Their
fingers and toes are decorated with silver rings, generally about
as thick as a lady’s bracelet in England. Their necks are freely
adorned with necklaces of large yellow or blue beads. Like most
native women, they are extremely fond of bright-coloured
dresses.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="chap_sum">Hippopotami — Game in the Wasulu country — Lazy
carriers — In pursuit of elephants — Fetish haartebeest — “Red”
elephants — A fetish altar — Braimah’s juju — Charms and tests.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AT Falama I found the two hunters I had engaged
for my shooting expedition. They were the head hunters of the
district, one of them being a man from the big hunting village of
Dialakoro, who was reputed to know every yard of the game haunts in
the Wasulu country, so it was with high hopes of good sport that I
began to talk over plans with these two local celebrities. The
Sankarani River runs in a semicircle round the village of Falama,
at a distance varying from one to three miles from the place. I was
informed that there was a hippopotamus pool in the river, so I
decided to bend my steps thither that afternoon, on the chance of
getting a hippo and also with a view to seeing the nature of the
country from a shooting standpoint.</p>

<p>Taking Braimah, the expert from Dialakoro, with me I set out
about 3 p.m. We traversed a patch of grass-country, in which I saw
traces of kob and waterbuck, for about a couple of miles before
reaching the river. Braimah led me to a well-worn hippo path in
some rather thick undergrowth near the river-bank, on the
off-chance of finding a hippo on land. After twisting and winding
for some time in this thicket, I heard the movements of a ponderous
body in front of us. This was without doubt the beast we were
hunting, and sure enough in a few minutes, after some careful
stalking through the bush, I caught sight of him.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span> He was within fifty yards, and
had just turned broadside on to listen, with his piglike eyes
looking in our direction. His massive form was plainly outlined at
that distance, as fortunately the bush was a little thinner here. A
shot from my ·450 rifle rolled him over, hitting him in the heart.
After this we made our way to the pool, taking up a concealed
position on the river bank. Three or four hippos shortly appeared,
frolicking in the clear, cool water of the pool. For some time I
lay in the shady refuge of the bushes, watching their playful
antics. It was an amusing sight to see these huge monsters
gradually and lazily raising their big heads out of the water,
until finally with a snort the whole head was thrust out to full
view, when, after drawing a deep breath, they would suddenly
disappear beneath the calm waters of the stream. After for some
time watching this pretty scene and regretting I had not brought my
camera, I decided to have a shot at a big bull who was in the
party. The best shot at a hippo in the water is one directed at his
nostrils, which can be seen when he thus raises his head.
Consequently the next time my friend appeared I fired at this spot.
It took three shots before I was satisfied I had killed him, and
then I turned away rather disgusted with the sport, for hippos are
harmless creatures and the amusement derived from shooting them
does not give one much satisfaction.</p>

<p>I have heard some men give the hippo credit for being vicious,
but personally I am of opinion that he will never wilfully harm
anyone. It is true they have been known frequently to overturn
canoes on a river, but I cannot help thinking that, when this does
occur, it is purely an accident, for the hippo is very blind and it
is quite conceivable that he may often raise his big head just
underneath a canoe without being aware of the latter’s presence. On
leaving the pool we soon picked up the tracks of a herd of kob,
which had recently passed that way. There was still<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span> an hour and a half before dark,
so I decided to follow them. We were now once more in the open
grass-land where the grass had been burnt in patches. Proceeding
cautiously up-wind, for these antelopes have a very keen sense of
hearing and smell, we espied the herd peacefully grazing in the
distance. After a careful stalk of 400 or 500 yards I managed to
secure a fair-sized male. It was now nearly dark, so we proceeded
towards camp. Parties were sent out to bring in the meat of the
first hippo and of the kob, and all the village was full of joy at
the prospect of plenty of “beef.”</p>

<p>The second hippo would have to be left till the following day,
for they sink when shot and the bodies do not float for about
twenty-four hours. A message was sent to the fishermen down-stream
to look out for the animal, and to bring it in as soon as it was
found. They were to have the meat on condition they brought me the
tusks, an arrangement which pleased everybody!</p>

<p>I had arranged with my hunters to proceed the next day to a
place called Doulajan, sixteen miles east, where they reported that
I would be in the centre of the elephant country. As my chief
object in visiting the Wasulu country was to hunt elephant, and my
time was limited, I was anxious to reach this locality as soon as
practicable. That day, after making my plans, I had already
despatched the second hunter to Doulajan to get all news of the
elephants’ whereabouts at that time and to meet me on my arrival at
camp, or as soon after as possible.</p>

<p>The next morning, as we set out, my heart was light at the
prospects of some really good sport, for I had every reason to
believe I was within easy reach of the elephant, and from all
accounts there were some fine tuskers among them.</p>

<p>That day, however, was doomed to be a day of annoyance and
disappointment. Leaving my carriers to follow<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_81">[81]</span> by the ordinary road, I and Braimah were
to leave before dawn by a small hunters’ track, known only to
himself, which would lead us through a favourite haunt of
waterbuck. I ordered my “boy” to meet me at a place where the two
paths crossed, at eleven for breakfast.</p>

<p>After a very hot and disappointing walk, during which I saw not
a single trace of waterbuck, we arrived at the place where I
proposed to breakfast. My carriers and servant had not arrived, so
I got a hut swept out by the chief and composed myself for a little
sleep. I was feeling fatigued, after the early start and the heat
of the day, so I slept for some hours and woke to find it was three
o’clock and still no sign of my carriers. I began to be uneasy that
some might have run away and could not be replaced. I was also by
this time uncommonly hungry, and decided to get some food from the
chief and then set out with Braimah to look for my “boy” Mamadu.
After a refreshing meal of fresh milk and pawpaw, I felt fortified
once more and departed with my hunter in quest of the missing
carriers and “boy.” We had gone three or four miles, I suppose,
when I heard a chattering proceeding from a tree close to the path
just in front of us. On turning a corner we came into full view of
Mamadu, the carriers and the loads all under a shady tree. The men
seemed to be enjoying themselves vastly and not to be in the least
concerned about me! My wrath can be more easily imagined than
described at the spectacle thus disclosed. Here had I been waiting
several hours for these lazy scoundrels and imagining all sorts of
disasters that might have befallen them, when all the time they
were simply loafing and enjoying a rest on the roadside. They
jumped up pretty sharply on my appearance, and proceeded to place
their loads on their heads. Mamadu was of course full of excuses to
account for the delay, but I fear he so perjured himself as to lose
any chance of a seat in heaven. The most annoying<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span> feature of the business was that
I should not now be able to reach my shooting-camp at Doulajan that
night. And it appeared that the only reason for all this delay was
that my servant might enjoy his silly habit of chattering!</p>

<p>It was quite dark when we reached the village where I should
have breakfasted, and here another disappointment awaited me. The
hunter I had sent to Doulajan had arrived with news, as I hoped, of
the elephant. His information was distinctly disheartening. He
stated that some hunters from the south of Wasulu had been among
the herd a few days previously and had driven them some distance
east of their previous feeding-ground. In fact, he stated that it
was rumoured the animals had gone almost to Odienné, which I knew
to be five or six days’ march from Doulajan. The only thing to be
done was to go on to Doulajan next day and follow up the elephants
if there seemed any chance of overtaking them within a reasonable
time.</p>

<p>The place I selected for my camp was on the banks of a small
stream, about five miles from the village of Doulajan. Here I
pitched my tent, which had hardly as yet come into requisition. The
spot was a delightful shady place, which seemed a veritable haunt
of wild game, judging by the numerous tracks of animals coming down
to drink at the stream hard by. I had procured a third local
hunter, and now sent two men off to get more definite news of the
elephant, while I kept one with me for shooting purposes near my
camp.</p>

<p>These hunters are strongly imbued with ideas of fetish. Braimah
had a long flint-lock gun of which he was inordinately proud. To a
native his gun is an object more to be cherished than his child. He
carries it with him everywhere, even when going to his peaceful
farm where there is no danger from man nor the likelihood of his
seeing any wild beast. This particular gun was
decorated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span> with every
imaginable sort of “juju,” or fetish charms. Panthers’ claws,
lions’ teeth, antelope horns and pieces of waterbuck’s hide adorned
the stock. The butt had a piece of elephant tail freely smeared in
the blood of the wild boar tied upon it. The latter animal is
particularly venerated for the good luck it is supposed to bring to
the sportsman.</p>

<p>Our camp was on more than one occasion visited by the wild
beasts of the neighbourhood. Leopards and hyenas were fairly
numerous here, while the deep musical roar of the lion was
frequently heard resounding through the bush at night.</p>

<p>One morning as I was making my toilet preparatory to an early
start on a hunting trip, I saw the beautiful sight of a herd of
about fifteen West African haartebeest coming down to drink at the
stream. My attention was at first attracted by hearing the
thundering of many hoofs on the stony ground outside the camp.
Rifle in hand I cautiously crept out of my tent, and soon they came
into full view, never suspecting the near presence of man, for our
camp was well concealed in the trees and they did not get our wind.
There is something awe-inspiring to my mind at the spectacle of
wild animals when they are unaware of the proximity of man and are
seen thus in their native haunts. Game is always most beautiful
when it is most natural and unalarmed. It makes one feel a brute to
shoot it, thereby destroying the life of a fine creature.</p>

<p>The West African haartebeest here were the best I saw during my
travels, and I secured two very good heads. These animals were
numerous in the Wasulu country, herds of twelve or fifteen being
frequently seen, although I never saw them in larger numbers than
this. This animal is, I suppose, quite the most clumsy-looking of
all West African antelopes, its curious, ill-shaped head and
lumbering gait reminding one more of a donkey than any<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span> other animal. I spent three days
thus and enjoyed some good sport with antelope. During my
expeditions I used to come across tracks of elephant fairly often.
These appeared to be at least a month old, and I began to doubt the
veracity of the statement that these animals had been seen here
more recently than that. It seemed to me evident that they had
retired towards the better watered country in the direction of the
Ivory Coast forest some considerable time previously.</p>

<p>The dry season was now in full swing and streams in the Wasulu
district were drying up rapidly. I observed two distinctly
different kinds of tracks. One lot appeared to be those of the
ordinary elephant, while the other lot seemed to belong to a
smaller species of that beast. On discussing the matter with my
hunter he confirmed my theory by stating that the smaller tracks
were those of a herd of the “red” elephant. This animal I had never
yet seen, but had heard it mentioned for the first time by some
French friends. At Faranah they had again told me of its existence.
So I was very eager to get a specimen. The elephant appears to be
of a reddish grey hue, probably terra-cotta would be a better
description, and to the best of my belief is peculiar to this
region, although as I never saw one, nor could I even see the skin
of one in the district, I am not in a position to give any more
authentic information on the point. It has the reputation of being
very fierce, and is said to charge without provocation, but I am
inclined to believe this is an exaggeration. It is certainly a good
deal smaller than the ordinary African elephant, and carries quite
small tusks by all accounts.</p>

<p>That day my two hunters returned, and much to my disappointment
their reports of the elephant were most discouraging, and made me
only more certain that the animals had left our vicinity some time
back, which would make my chance of ever coming up with them
exceedingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span> remote.
The same evening I got news, however, from the chief of Doulajan
that he had heard on the most reliable authority that the herd had
been seen at a place three days’ march from our camp, close to
Odienné. I at once determined to proceed there on the chance of
there being some truth in the yarn, although I must confess that I
was not very sanguine as to the success of my quest.</p>

<p>Striking camp at an early hour in the morning, we marched for
three days through a more wooded country, gradually verging into
forest-land. Tracks of elephant were numerous, but these were by no
means fresh. Finally, I was forced to abandon the enterprise, for I
was daily getting farther and farther from my northerly route, and
could afford no more time to spend in hunting in this country.</p>

<p>The dense forest we were now in reminded me how extremely
difficult it is to see these huge beasts in country of this nature.
I recollect once when tracking a large herd from an early hour
until late in the afternoon, through a swampy country, I had quite
lost all traces of them and began to despair of finding them again.
I was on the point of turning homewards, but thought I would first
cross a neighbouring swamp to have some lunch on the opposite bank,
which appeared dry. Being on the point of sitting down I suddenly
observed what appeared to be a moving leaf. On closer inspection it
proved to be the ear of an elephant not more than twenty yards away
and concealed in the foliage. A little manœuvring resulted in a
successful stalk, and the animal, which was a fine tusker, was
bagged. These beasts, although not actually deaf, get so accustomed
to forest sounds that they had never heard our somewhat noisy
approach across the swamp.</p>

<p>My plan was to return to Falama on the Sankarani River, where I
had arranged for fresh carriers to meet me, and from thence to
proceed to Bamako by the shortest<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_86">[86]</span> route. The hunting villages which are passed
in this district gave a very fair indication of the game to be
found in the neighbourhood. It is the custom to erect outside the
village a high altar, built up with the horns of antelope and the
skulls of almost every conceivable beast shot by the local hunting
people. This altar is erected for fetish purposes, the heads being
allowed to remain there till they rot. The native hunter has no
sense of sport as we look upon it. He kills wild animals primarily
for the meat he will get, and, as trophies of the chase, horns and
skins have no value in his eyes. Some of the more dangerous animals
may sometimes be hunted for the danger involved in attacking them,
but even then it is done more out of bravado than from the love and
excitement of the sport.</p>

<p>One of my hunters had a native flute which he would play at
night in camp to amuse himself and his companions. The instrument
is a very simple one, made out of a reed-cane, having a few holes
punched in it to form the notes, and a roughly shaped mouthpiece.
The music is melancholy, and by no means disagreeable. He was a
lithely built, active fellow, making a picturesque figure as he sat
in the glow of the firelight playing strange native melodies on his
instrument.</p>

<p>Braimah had a greater weakness for “Juju” than the others. His
chief care, after seeing to his gun before our start every morning,
was to find out if Diana intended to favour our sport that day. The
method adopted to carry out this test was a curious one. The only
things necessary to work the charm were two kola nuts. His
procedure was as follows:</p>

<p>A kola was taken in each hand and some mystic words were then
muttered over them, the gist of which was, as far as I could
understand, something like this: “May the God of the Chase grant me
good fortune, and may he cause these two kolas to point towards
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
</p>

<p>The kolas were then thrown in the air, and the way in which they
landed on the ground decided the luck that was going to be his that
day. If the two kolas fell with their ends both pointing towards
the thrower all would be well. On the other hand, if the kolas,
when they reached the earth, had the pointed ends turned away from
Braimah, then the God of Hunting was full of wrath and would not be
appeased that day. If one nut was pointing towards him and the
other in the inverse direction, the operation had to be repeated
three times before a definite decision could be arrived at. It must
be explained for the benefit of those who have never seen a kola
nut that one end is more pointed than the other. The shape of the
nut resembles that of a Brazil nut, a sort of pyramid on a
triangular base, and the colour is either white or pink.</p>

<p>Braimah’s trick, I noticed, often did not give a correct
forecast of the day’s performances. When I tackled him on this
point he always had some ready excuse on his tongue, and I never
succeeded in shaking his conviction of the infallibility of the
charm. As a matter of fact, a native has such a strongly rooted
belief in his various fetishes and superstitions that it seems
quite impossible ever to shake it. Of course, in many cases, when
fetishes are in the hands of “medicine-men,” these people are so
crafty that the particular charm they are working appears never to
fail. I have in mind the charm used for the purpose of testing
adultery among certain tribes. In this case the accused is told to
drink a mixture made of the infusion of leaves of the cotton tree
and some other ingredients, the reasoning being that if he drinks
it and vomits he is innocent, but if he is guilty he will die in
agonies. As a matter of fact, the result is a foregone conclusion,
for if the “medicine-man” wishes the death of his victim he merely
puts a little deadly poison into the concoction, thereby producing
the desired result, while the natural property of the mixture is
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span> make the imbiber
vomit. This performance is carried out in the midst of the
congregated villagers, so that the effect produced on their
ignorant and superstitious minds is tremendous.</p>

<p>If the accused man is rich, he can generally buy his innocence
by a judicious bribe paid to the “medicine-man.” Fetish priests
wield great power over the people in West Africa. Their influence
is in a way similar to that of the “Mullahs” in the East among
Mohammedans. The latter stir up the people to mad religious fervour
by their frenzied preachings in much the same manner that the
fetish priest excites the minds of his hearers.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AT Falama I procured the requisite carriers
from the chief. It was arranged that they should accompany me all
the way to the Niger, should I find any difficulty in replacing
them before that river was reached. I was particularly careful to
have this explained to each individual carrier in the presence of
his chief, for I had had some experience of the difficulty of
keeping these men to their promises already. A favourite trick of
this class of gentleman is, after being most fervent in his
protests of wishing for no happier lot than to accompany you as far
as you want to go, suddenly, and generally at a most awkward
moment, to casually cast your belongings into the bush and run
away. One has in such cases nothing but the grim consolation that
he has deprived himself of his pay, which is but poor satisfaction
for the annoyance and inconvenience he causes you. The chief of
Falama was a man of some influence, being also one of the leading
magnates of the Wasulu country. I therefore hoped that his
authority would be sufficient to ensure their remaining faithful to
me.</p>

<p>At Falama Mamadu invested in a new hat. This was a wonderful bit
of head-gear. The hat was made of plaited straw of several bright
colours, among which green and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_90">[90]</span> red were most prominent. It was made with a
very wide brim, and the top worked up to a point, in conical
fashion. It certainly had the advantage of protecting him from the
glare of the sun, for it was at least two sizes too big for him, so
that it descended right over his eyes and almost rested on the
bridge of his nose. He was greatly pleased with his new purchase,
bringing it to me to show off with much pride.</p>

<p>Among my new carriers I noticed one with different tribal marks
from the rest. On inquiry I was told he came from the Sanafou
country near the Ivory Coast Colony. His face was beautifully
decorated with four semicircular gashes, each about a quarter of an
inch wide, down both sides. These cuts started on the temple about
on the level of the eyes, and went right down the cheeks to the
mouth, at which point they converged. They certainly gave him a
very remarkable appearance, rather suggestive at a distance of the
black marks put on the face of a clown in a circus. A good
knowledge of tribal marks will often enable one to tell the tribe
of a man at sight. They are not, however, an infallible proof of
the tribe of an individual, for sometimes a boy, when taken into
slavery, will have the marks of his master’s tribe cut upon his
face. Some races do not practise the custom of tribal marks. But it
is generally done in all pagan nations. The Wasulu marks consisted
of two or three very thin cuts made vertically down each cheek,
usually not more than three inches long. The marks were often so
slight as not to be noticeable except at close quarters.</p>

<p>My shortest road was across the Sankarani River, then up the
valley of the Fie, finally crossing the Niger a little south of
Kangaba, and following its left bank to Bamako. A reliable guide
was an unknown article in these parts. The natives of this region
are not traders, consequently they travel little. I had to depend
on getting a guide day<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_91">[91]</span> by day to lead me through the bush-country
which intervened between me and the Niger; but once on the other
side of that stream, there was said to be an excellent road leading
to Bamako.</p>

<p>The first part of the journey lay across hills of laterite rock.
Our track could only by courtesy be dignified by the name of a
path. The country was practically uninhabited, although, as usual
in this district, there were numerous traces of ruined villages,
all testifying to the devastations of Samory.</p>

<p>At one place I saw the remains of a hut, rapidly falling into
decay. I was rather surprised to observe a weather-beaten old board
nailed on a tree opposite the door. This board had some writing on
it, which was with difficulty decipherable. It stated that a man
called Paul Rieu had for two years made his home in that hut, where
he had stayed while seeking gold in the vicinity. As a proof of his
words I could see pits dug at the small river near by, and
evidently made by him during his search for the precious metal. He
must have been all alone; and what a dreary life to lead in this
desolate spot, with nothing but the wild African bush for miles on
all sides! I conclude his search was not successful. The poor
fellow must have gone away disappointed after two years of lonely
toiling under the hot tropical sun.</p>

<p>After this the country began to get more open, and it was
evident that we were rapidly descending towards the Sankarani
River. We passed through a wide grassy plain on to the right bank
of the river. It looked a likely place for kob, which are fond of
the marshy swamps bordering on streams; but though I saw some
fairly fresh tracks we did not come across any of these antelope.
The river is about 100 yards wide here, and has a very swift
current. I looked in vain for a canoe, as it was impossible to ford
it. In the distance we could see a village on the far
bank,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span> but the people
could not, or would not, hear our repeated shouts. A few shots from
my rifle eventually brought out some men who half hid in the bush,
thinking we were come to “make war.” Probably the last time they
had heard rifles fired was during the Sofa war, and the
unaccustomed sound called up unwelcome memories of rapine and
slaughter. With some difficulty I managed to reassure them, and
proceeded to explain we merely wanted a canoe to convey us and our
belongings to the other shore.</p>

<p>We halted at the village, which was called Balandougou, and it
was here that my troubles with the porters commenced.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I had been out to see if I could pick up a few
bushfowl on some likely-looking farms close by, and on my return
was met by Mamadu, who told me that he had heard the carriers
talking about deserting me. Although I only wanted eight men, I was
aware that it would be extremely hard to get any to replace them at
this village, which had only a score of inhabitants, mostly
decrepit men and women or quite young children. I was therefore
determined not to give them the opportunity of bolting. Further, I
was much annoyed at their faithless behaviour, after their promises
to accompany me until I reached the Niger, if necessary. I summoned
them at once, telling them I had knowledge of their intention to
desert, and that any man attempting to do so would be flogged. They
all denied they had ever been guilty of such a base thought! But,
needless to say, I did not believe them. That night I made them all
sleep in the same hut, pitching my camp bed outside one exit, while
Mamadu was made to sleep outside the other.</p>

<p>This little arrangement successfully stopped them from carrying
out any projects they might have formed. Next day I had to take
precautions on the march to prevent their defection. I constituted
myself rearguard, making<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_93">[93]</span> my servant walk beside the leading carrier,
and in this order we proceeded until we arrived at a large village
about eleven o’clock. Here I decided to halt for breakfast and
interview the headman with a view to getting fresh porters. As a
matter of fact, the headman of the place was a local chief of some
importance, as I soon perceived, when he arrived dressed in a
finely embroidered gown and wearing a sword. Certain chiefs in
Guinea are allowed by the French to wear swords as a mark of rank.
He came with a picturesque following of courtiers, such as these
men love to surround themselves with.</p>

<p>They have usually several advisers among them, and it is quite
amusing to notice how the advisers often rule their king.
Frequently, when asking a chief a question, one will notice that he
is not even given the chance of answering for himself; his
so-called adviser chips in with his answer before the chief has
time to open his mouth! They came to the hut which had been
prepared for my breakfast, sitting down at my invitation. After a
lengthy palaver it was settled that eight carriers were to be sent
to the spot where I should camp that night to replace my present
gang. This seemed preferable to the alternative of waiting here
till evening for the young men to come in from their farms, where
they were now at work. I despatched Mamadu to inform my porters
that they would be released that same night as soon as their
reliefs arrived, and then settled myself down to breakfast. It
never occurred to me that it would be necessary to any longer keep
guard over them, as they now knew they would so soon be
released.</p>

<p>After my meal I went outside the hut for a stroll, when to my
disgust I saw only three carriers remaining, while a couple of them
were just to be seen running as fast as their legs would carry them
towards the bush in the distance. Having threatened the remaining
three with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span> dire
vengeance should they try to follow their comrades, I despatched
Mamadu to the chief to order him to have the defaulters caught
without delay. At the end of a couple of hours the fugitives were
brought back, and I was able to proceed on my journey. We resumed
the march in the same order as that morning, for it was obviously
not safe to let them go unguarded.</p>

<p>All the time I was rather anxious as to the chances of the chief
fulfilling his promises about sending me the fresh carriers that
night. However, there was nothing to be done but to hope for the
best, and in the meantime to keep a sharp eye on my present
porters. That night I halted at a small stream, which was the only
water within some miles, and was the place where I had directed the
new carriers to meet me. I did not much relish the prospects of the
evening before me; keeping a watch on the would-be truants and
slumber were two things that would hardly reconcile themselves
without the assistance of the friendly hut of yesterday. About 9
p.m., however, to my joy, I heard a commotion outside the small
camp, and on going out of my tent found it indicated the arrival of
the carriers from the previous halting-place. The chief had after
all been honest to his promises, and I had been unjust to his
majesty.</p>

<p>The following morning I made a very early start, about four
o’clock, with the intention of trying for a West African eland. My
“boy” and carriers were to go on to a small village only some ten
miles away, where I would join them that night. I had been told
that eland were to be found in this neighbourhood, and had myself
seen tracks of one the previous day. Not having time to wait more
than a day in that part of the country, I did not feel inclined to
go away without trying my luck after one of these fine animals. The
eland is one of the very largest of West African antelopes, and is
decidedly rare. The horns make a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_95">[95]</span> splendid trophy, which I was most anxious to
add, if possible, to my collection. One of my new carriers
professed to be a hunting-man out of work and to know the country
well, so I had arranged to take him with me. We were now on the
watershed between the Rivers Fie and Sankarani, a rather sparsely
wooded country, intersected by several small streams which flowed
down on either side to join the two big rivers in due course. The
haunts of the eland were said to be on the eastern side towards the
Sankarani River, whither we directed our steps.</p>

<p>The ground slopes gradually here down to the river, and was some
of the prettiest scenery I had seen since my entry into French
Guinea. Large stretches of open grass-land alternated with
park-like country, and occasionally one came on a more thickly
wooded part, through which ran sylvan glades, carpeted with
emerald-green grass, by the side of which flowed a tiny stream of
crystal water. The spot seemed a paradise for game of all sorts,
judging by the numerous tracks. My time was too limited,
unfortunately, to allow of other game than eland to be pursued. I
must own I felt sorry now that I had not come straight to this
place instead of spending those last few days in Wasulu on a
fruitless expedition after the elephant. I simply could not afford
to spend more than the single day in this pleasant game-haunted
locality. My plan was to devote all my time till four o’clock to
the joys of the chase, by which hour, if luck favoured me, I hoped
to have bagged an eland; in any case, I would have to wend my steps
campward by that time, as I should probably have three or four
hours of walking in front of me.</p>

<p>My cherished hopes were, however, doomed to disappointment, for
although we searched all the most likely places, not a sign of the
beasts could we discover. There were, it was true, a good many old
tracks, but that was poor<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_96">[96]</span> consolation. It seemed that I was out of luck
just now; first there was my disappointment about the elephant in
Wasulu, and now the evasive eland was having a laugh at my expense.
Cheering myself up with the thought that there must be a good time
in store for me in the near future, at four o’clock I directed my
shikari to show me the homeward path. It was dark by the time we
got out of the bush on to the track, and I was not sorry at last to
see the cheerful glow of a fire in the distance which indicated the
position of my hut. I had been on my legs for a good many hours
that day, and that, with the natural feeling of disappointment,
made me feel really tired. A hot bath, dinner and a pipe by the
fireside made me feel a new man again. It was my invariable custom
to have a fire of logs at night. This was useful more especially to
keep off the mosquitoes, which are always most assiduous in their
onslaughts after sunset.</p>

<p>Sand-flies, too, were bad in many places, and the ordinary
mosquito-net was of no use against these tiny, venomous creatures.
The meshes, close enough to protect you from the attacks of the
“anopheles,” were by no means impermeable to the minute sand-fly.
Fortunately for me, I had previous experience of these wicked
insects, and had prepared myself with a net of close meshes to
guard me against their unwelcome attentions. To travellers in the
bush I would always recommend a net with fine meshes, for
sand-flies are not uncommon in any part of West Africa. The chief
drawback is that one naturally feels hotter in this pattern of net,
but to my mind this is infinitely preferable to being tortured by
sand-flies all night, thereby making sleep a physical
impossibility.</p>

<p>On my arrival I was told by Mamadu that the chief had refused to
provide “chop” for the carriers, saying he had none in the place. I
at once sent for the old man to ask for some explanation, as I was
well aware that rice or<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_97">[97]</span> millet was fairly abundant at this time of
year, and my party was a small one to cater for.</p>

<p>After a good deal of palaver and threats on my part of reporting
him to the Commissioner at Siguiri, in which district I was now
travelling, he was reduced to a more sensible frame of mind, and
hurried off to carry out my orders with considerable alacrity. This
was the first occasion on which I had had any trouble about
rationing my followers.</p>

<p>The French have an excellent custom in Guinea, and one which I
had previously never found to fail me. When a white man arrives in
a village it is the duty of the chief or headman, without any order
from the traveller, to at once provide and cook sufficient food for
the whole party of carriers and “boys.” The ration is about one and
a half pounds of rice or millet per head. The meal is brought to
the European for inspection about sundown, and payment is then made
at the tariff rates. In some places the headman or chief will bring
presents of fowls, or perhaps some eggs. When the native is a rich
man he will often even produce a sheep or cow. These presents, of
course, cannot be accepted without payment, or a return present in
kind of about equal value. Some people give a return present of
much greater value in money or kind, but this system seems to me to
be a bad one, as it encourages these natives to make a sort of
trade, most profitable to themselves, in so-called “presents.”</p>

<p>The French deprecate the habit of paying more than the actual
value to the individual concerned. I have frequently found this
custom of “presents” such a nuisance that I now inform the chief on
my arrival in a town of exactly what I require in the way of food,
at the same time telling him that “presents” are not wanted. There
is no doubt that this saves a good deal of annoyance and
unnecessary expense. It would, for instance, be most
inconvenient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span> and
rather expensive to be “dashed” a bullock, when one’s following
only consisted of eight persons, and to have to expend four or five
pounds in payment therefor. To encumber oneself with a live bullock
until one had a chance to dispose of it would be an impossibility,
and the only alternative is to slaughter it at once. It will be
realized that this sort of entertainment, if repeated three or four
times, would soon lead to bankruptcy! I recollect seeing a curious
and amusing kind of “dash” made on one occasion.</p>

<p>A friend of mine, who was a distinguished official, had been to
a country which had only lately come under control of the
Government, and in which the natives were unaccustomed to the usual
method of showing their appreciation of a white man’s visit. They
evidently thought that this was a moment when a great effort must
be made to display their generosity. A solemn cortège arrived,
headed by the chief, with the “dash.” I shall never forget the
horror-stricken look on my friend’s face when, with due ceremony, a
young girl was produced and handed over to him. As the official in
question was a particularly shy and modest man, the full humour of
the situation will be thoroughly appreciated.</p>

<p>The following day the country began to take on a more populated
appearance. Large expanses of land planted with crops of millet and
cassada were to be seen, while villages became more frequent and
natives passed us from time to time on the road. About eight
o’clock in the morning we arrived at the top of a big hill, upon
the summit of which there was perched a small hamlet. The headman
brought out a calabash of delicious fresh milk, rich and frothy,
just drawn from the cow. I gladly took a cup of the refreshing
beverage while we were waiting for the last carriers to come in.
These people were Jomongonas, a section of the widely distributed
Malinké tribe. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
are purely agriculturists, as was indeed evidenced by the wide
farms of waving crops through which we had passed.</p>

<p>The view from the top of this hill was magnificent. We were now
well down the western slope of the Sankarani-Fie watershed, and
from here I got my first glimpse of the latter river. To the north
there ran a mass of isolated peaks, like a series of broken links
in the chain of hills along which we had been marching for the last
two days. The reddish-brown hue of the laterite rocks of which they
were formed made a pleasing contrast to the golden fields of ripe
millet scattered chequerwise over their steep sides. Far away in
the south could be seen the River Fie, a tiny shimmering streak of
water, gradually widening, as it flowed westward to join the Niger,
into an imposing expanse. The valley through which it flowed was a
wide, fruitful plain, where cassada and millet crops jostled
against each other, and in the centre of which could be discerned a
thin line of rich, dark green foliage, marking the course of the
winding stream.</p>

<p>Overhead was a bright, azure sky with the golden rays of the
morning sun shining upon the smiling landscape. We rested that
night at the town of Jilingé, the biggest place I had yet seen in
the bush-country of Guinea, and the centre of the millet-growing
district. Jilingé consists of three large villages, each of which
on a rough estimate must contain 2000 inhabitants. The central
village is the principal one, and it is here the chief of the
Jomongonas resides. I was lodged in a palatial hut, with two
imposing, carved wooden doors, and what was more to the purpose,
they were doors through which one could enter without fear of
knocking one’s head. Most West African huts have one point in
common, that the doors are built so low that it is necessary for
the shortest person who wishes to enter to double him or herself up
in a most undignified fashion if a severe blow on the head is to be
avoided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
</p>

<p>My house was also roomy and airy in comparison to the average
edifice it had been my fate to live in, so I began to feel myself
in luxury. My feelings of comfort and rest were, however, soon to
be crushed. Mamadu arrived at the door with a long face, which I
felt sure meant some catastrophe of a serious nature. His news was
that the carriers had all bolted. This was really too annoying just
when I thought I had got matters satisfactorily arranged till we
should reach the Niger. I suppose the sight of such a metropolis,
as Jilingé must appear to them, had produced this demoralizing
effect. I summoned the chief for a palaver on the carrier question,
with imprecations on my lips against the faithless fugitives. The
chief was amiability itself, and promised me as many men as I
should want for the following day; but there was one small matter
on which we could not agree. He said the carriers should take my
loads as far as the next village, where I could procure fresh men,
who would carry for me to the succeeding village, and so on.</p>

<p>As the country was now getting thickly populated, it appeared
that I would have to change my porters every two miles or so, in
other words, ten times before reaching the Niger! It is hardly to
be wondered at that I vowed I would never do this, even if I had to
take the chief with me to ensure my carriers remaining faithful. He
intimated that this was the custom of the country, and had so been
from time immemorial. I politely replied that I was the last person
in the world to wish to break old customs (this custom did seem
such a probable one!), but that it was also a custom for chiefs to
supply white men with carriers when necessary, and for as long as
they might be required in a particular “cercle,” as the French call
their districts. It was not till I had tried every conceivable
argument, and had at last to resort to the old threat of reporting
him to the Commissioner, that he finally<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_101">[101]</span> promised his men should go as far as I
desired. True it is that by this time I was aware the chiefs had
not much influence over their people, and the promise he had given
might be broken through no fault of his; still, it would have been
impossible to get the fellows even to start without him, so I had
to hope for the best while fearing the worst.</p>

<p>On leaving Jilingé we passed several small streams, flowing
towards the Fie, in which natives were to be seen washing gold. The
metal is found in small quantities about the Fie River, and this is
noticeable, as many women wear gold ornaments in this region. Every
village has a native goldsmith, who fashions rough trinkets, such
as ear-rings, bracelets, etc., for the adornment of the local
beauties. The gold in this part is entirely alluvial, according to
native information. I should imagine even this is only found in
very small quantities. The gold mines are on the other side of the
Niger in the direction of Buré, some fifty miles north-west of the
town of Siguiri. I did not visit Siguiri myself, but I understand
that there are several European companies there who are interested
in gold. British and German are said to predominate, but at present
business is not very bright in the mines.</p>

<p>We marched for some miles up the Fie valley before striking the
right bank of the stream.</p>

<p>This was the last river of any size to be crossed before meeting
the Niger. Here I noticed a peculiar thing connected with native
superstition, and one I had likewise remarked at the crossing of
the Sankarani. The Fie was the natural geographical boundary of the
Jomongona tribe. A belief existed among the people that any man who
should cross this “Rubicon” would bring misfortune to his family.
It seems curious that a tribe should be afraid of passing the
boundary into the next country, when the two tribes were at peace,
but so it was. On account of this superstition the Jomongonas have
not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span> spread
westward, nor have they had any intercourse with the people over
their border. Intermarriage between the two races seemed to be
unknown. I was unaware that this strange belief existed until I
reached the river and noticed the hesitation of my carriers to
cross it.</p>

<p>My difficulties now appeared to be on the verge of recommencing.
What was the use of chiefs who promised by all they held sacred to
ensure the loyalty of the porters, when there remained strong
superstitions of this kind to be overcome? Having placed their
loads on the ground they stoutly refused to move a yard farther. My
situation was comical if it had not been so tragic. Here was I,
with my worldly possessions, stuck on the bank of this river in the
middle of the bush, while my carriers refused to advance a step and
might at any moment run away, leaving us in the lurch without any
prospect of replacing them. I tried in turn gentle persuasion and
threats of chastisement. The former had the effect such methods
generally produce on natives of making them think I was “soft,”
while the latter had the equally disastrous effect of making them
so frightened that, if I had not stopped the ringleaders myself,
they would have all run away. There seemed to be only one way out
of the predicament. I called Mamadu, telling him to make all haste
and return to the chief of Jilingé with a message from me that he
must come to the Fie at once and palaver. The carriers were
informed of my intentions, and told to remain till his arrival.
Mamadu went off, and I took up a position on the bank above the
men, where I could watch any attempt at desertion, at the same time
taking the precaution to place my rifle by my side—an act of which
they realized the significance.</p>

<p>I had now to possess my soul in patience, for Mamadu and the
chief could not possibly arrive for a couple of hours, it being
quite three miles to the town. The porters did not give any
trouble, but sat silently and sullenly below<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_103">[103]</span> me. Never had two hours seemed so long!
Eventually, to my joy, I espied my servant, heading a small
procession, moving across the plain towards me. The chief and his
followers seated themselves around me, and, to cut a long story
short, after a long discussion, in which he was made to understand
that if he did not compel his men to cross with my loads, he would
be made to come with me to the nearest Commissioner, he did what I
required.</p>

<p>When the last load had been despatched to the other bank I let
him depart, made happy with a present of a small packet of tea and
sugar, and vowing that the carriers would give me no further cause
for annoyance. On this point I had my doubts, but told him I
sincerely hoped for his sake that they would not, as I should
certainly report the whole occurrence to the Commissioner.</p>

<p>These vexatious delays had caused me to lose many precious
hours, and I now pushed on as rapidly as possible to the Niger,
which we reached on the 17th of February, at a place called
Balandougou-Somno-Bara, not far from the large village of Nafadié.
For the time being, at any rate, I had no more carrier troubles,
and was quite as glad as they were to see the big river once
more.</p>

<p>At this village with the very long name there is a canoe ferry.
The river was about 300 yards wide at this point, but divided into
two streams of equal width by a long, narrow sandbank. While
watching my loads being transported I noticed a river barge, under
full sail, going up-stream towards Bamako. It was the property of a
French trading firm, the name of which was inscribed in large
letters on the sails. These barges are made of wood, and will carry
two or three tons of merchandise. The usual period of transit from
Kouroussa or Kankan to Bamako occupies seven days. During the rainy
season, when there is plenty of water, barges of twenty-five tons
burden can navigate this portion of the stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
</p>

<p>I calculated I must be about 100 miles south of Bamako, and
determined to push on that night to Tombola, on the other bank,
which was on the main Siguiri-Bamako road.</p>

<p>While the transport operations were going on Mamadu, whose duty
it was to see the loads safely shipped, disappeared. On looking up
the river I observed him in the distance, stealthily approaching a
group of waterfowl of all sizes and descriptions, which were
sunning themselves on the sandy bank of the stream. The ground was
as flat as at pancake, without any sort of cover, and it was
obvious that his painful endeavours to advance unperceived were
doomed to failure. Sure enough, the birds soon rose in a cloud,
flying off out of sight round a bend of the river. Mamadu went
forward, however, to the spot where they had been, where he stooped
to pick up something. I took no further notice of his movements,
until I heard his familiar voice close by. He then appeared,
staggering under the weight of a big fish, which must have weighed
at least twenty pounds, and had the look of an Indian mahseer. The
fish was beginning to rot, and had such an unpleasant smell that I
bade him remove it at once. This he did with a look of reproach, as
much as to say that this was an ungrateful way of showing my
appreciation of his labours.</p>

<p>For the benefit of the uninitiated I may state that the native
prefers rotten fish to the fresh article, probably and justly
thinking there is more flavour about it. Mamadu’s version of his
adventure was highly amusing. He said that seeing a bird near the
water, which was “très bon manger,” he had intended to try to catch
it with a small fishing-net which he had found close by. His idea
was to approach within a few yards and then lasso it! Several of
the birds were pelicans, and had evidently been discussing their

</p>

<p>The people here are mostly fishermen. They catch many kinds of
fish in the Niger, some of which have an excellent flavour. The
best fish I ever tasted was the “capitaine”; it runs up to ten or
twelve pounds weight frequently, and is beautifully firm. Many of
the Niger fish are difficult to eat on account of the numerous
bones they contain, but this variety has few bones. Electric mud
fish are fairly common when the river is low. They are flat,
reminding one of dabs, and if you touch them you experience a
decided electric shock. These fish make a peculiar “clucking” sort
of noise, by which they can often be easily located. The native
fisherman catches his fish with nets, or more frequently in traps.
In some parts they even spear fish, but it is unusual on this
portion of the Niger.</p>

<p>It is a usual sight in the early morning to see the father of
the family, accompanied by his son, often quite a small urchin,
setting out from his village in a dug-out canoe for the
fishing-ground. He then casts his net into the water, dragging it
while the little chap sits in the stern and cleverly manipulates
the paddle. These fisherfolk are brought up, almost from the
cradle, to paddle a canoe; it is wonderful with what energy and
endurance the youngsters will propel the craft. On the Niger it is
unusual to see the women paddling, but in other West African rivers
this is a common sight.</p>

<p>The fish-traps are generally made of reed-canes, in the shape of
a cone, with the base open and the apex tightly closed. A series of
these are placed in some suitable spot, such as a backwater, the
bases being turned up-stream. There are several devices for keeping
the fish in once they have entered the base of the cone, but the
principle is that of a trap door which closes on the victim as soon
as it has entered.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">OUR route to Tombola lay across a marshy, open
stretch of land for some miles. The marsh was dried up in many
places, and a rank, coarse grass grew over it to a height of seven
or eight feet. This place was the haunt of herds of kob. The
natives evidently were not hunters, for these animals could be seen
within half a mile of a village; in fact, one I shot was close to a
village. The kob is a beautiful creature, and the herds we saw made
a pretty picture as they streamed away in the distance with their
easy, graceful strides which cover the ground so rapidly. Once or
twice we disturbed a whole family party, who, unaware of our
approach as we came up against the wind, suddenly emerged from
amidst the waving grass, not more than a hundred yards away,
throwing up their beautiful heads to stare at us for an instant and
then scampering off in alarm to a safer distance. With that
curiosity so fatal to the antelope, they would halt after galloping
a short way and turn broadside on to have another stare at the
intruders of their domains. This was the moment for the sportsman
to take his shot, and it was at such an occasion that I bagged my
beast.</p>

<p>The country now assumed a more wooded aspect. Trees of the
nature of an African oak were dotted here and there<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span> over the grassy surface of the
ground, while small rivulets, with steep banks and deep pools in
their rocky beds, were the happy playgrounds of merry parties of
hippopotami, who disported themselves in full enjoyment of the
bright scorching rays of the sun. These rivulets were tributaries
or backwaters of the Niger, breaking up the otherwise even surface
of the land. After halting at one of these streams for the thirsty
carriers to drink, we espied close by the big road which we must
follow to Bamako. The road is a mere sandy track, thirty or forty
feet wide, worn, by the feet of hundreds of passers-by and herds of
cattle, into a passably level route. Level, that is to say, for a
West African road, but not at all suitable for a two-wheeled cart,
as its evenness is broken by frequent ruts, probably made by the
rains. But this road is a trade route of some importance, leading
as it does from the metropolis of the French Soudan to the heart of
French Guinea, and passing through the large markets dotted about
the left bank of the Upper Niger.</p>

<p>We constantly met large herds of cattle, usually owned by Moors,
as the French indiscriminately call the inhabitants of the vast
territory north of the Senegal River, which reaches up to the
confines of Morocco, in Northern Africa. These people are great
traders, but dishonest, often lazy, and the most unblushing liars
in the world, I should imagine. They are also very dirty in their
person and their habits. The Moors, however, possess some excellent
qualities, for they are extremely intelligent and most enduring on
the march. Their knowledge of cattle-tending must be great, as
these beasts are brought hundreds of miles from the interior of
Mauretania to the markets of Guinea without any appreciable loss of
animals. The Moor is a cunning trader, who makes large profits out
of his transactions with the more simple-minded Malinké. Their
faces are pale, dirty whitish yellow, their features<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span> are aquiline, while their
noses have a distinctly Jewish, hooky appearance.</p>

<p>The Moor has bright, piercing black eyes, which are a sufficient
testimony of his shrewd nature. On the march the cowherd travels on
foot with his beasts, driving the huge droves in front of him with
many weird cries and much thwacking with a stout stick, stopping
every now and then to chase a truant out of the bush whither he has
wandered to enjoy a succulent mouthful of grass, at the same time
heaping imprecations on the luckless animal’s head. They travel
slowly, and will probably cover only ten miles in one day. It is by
no means unusual for a caravan of cattle to take three months over
its journey. The master does not accompany his animals. He is far
too superior a person. He is the proud possessor of a horse, and
follows his cowherds at leisure. On arriving at my halting-place in
the evening, about five o’clock, I have frequently seen this
individual just mounting his steed in order to follow the herds we
had passed that day. Riding his mount he will cover the distance to
their halting-place in a couple of hours, and sleep there that
night. The cattle are fine, big animals, and are the humped
variety. They have huge, branching horns, stout bodies and short,
strong legs. The cows have small udders, and give but little milk
in comparison to an English milch cow of their size.</p>

<p>Besides cattle the Moors bring large quantities of rancid butter
and curdled milk to the French Soudan, where these find a ready
market. The butter, which is carried in leather bags called
“guerba,” is specially appreciated by the natives, who do not
appear in the very least to be disconcerted by the unpleasant smell
thereof. The Moors speak a harsh, guttural language containing a
good many Arabic words. Their knowledge of the native languages is
small, hardly extending beyond an acquaintance with<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span> sufficient market expressions
to enable them to drive a good bargain. When they arrive at a
village they herd together in their own quarter of the place,
mingling little with the West African natives, whom they despise
with a contempt they take no pains to conceal.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw3" id="i08"><img src="images/i08.jpg" alt=

<div>
<p class="sc">Natives Pounding Rice at Tombola</p>

<p class="justify">This village, which is in the south of the Upper
Senegal and Niger Colony, is in the rice-growing country of that
region. Rice is the staple native food, and it is a familiar scene
to watch it being pounded in a large wooden mortar by means of a
heavy wooden pestle. This work is usually performed by the women or
small boys.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is a sound principle to avoid camping in the neighbourhood of
Moors, on account of their thieving propensities; indeed, with
their long, unkempt hair and wild, fierce faces they have such an
unprepossessing appearance that one naturally shuns coming into
close contact with such rascally-looking people.</p>

<p>It was noticeable as we advanced that we were getting into a
land more under the influence of Islam than heretofore. In every
village was a place set aside for the mosque. This consisted simply
of a few rough logs, laid on the ground in the form of a hollow
square, with a break at one side for the doorway. At sunset the
“muezzin” could be heard calling the faithful to prayer, and a
large proportion of the villagers would obey the summons.
Mohammedanism is undoubtedly making great strides in this part of
Africa, but as yet the Mussulmans are far from being devout
followers of the teachings of the Prophet. Drinking, for instance,
is far from unusual, but the religion has certainly had a
beneficial influence on these people in more ways than one, and
they are decidedly all morally better for their conversion from
paganism.</p>

<p>After leaving Tombola we marched for two days through a sandy
country, where the vegetation was more stunted and water more
scarce. Although within three or four miles of the left bank of the
Niger, running water is scarce near the villages on the roadside.
Most of them dig wells, for water is found close to the surface of
the ground, and this is preferable to sending daily to the river
for their supply. In the rainy season there is not this difficulty
about water, as the whole country is low-lying and
would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span> be inundated
by the river. The lesser bustard I saw and shot frequently in this
region, where the flat, grassy plains are a favourable haunt of
this bird.</p>

<p>All this bank of the Niger is much inhabited by the cobus kob;
every morning early I used to see large herds grazing in the
distance near the river. Stalking here was a difficult matter as
the country was so open. Except for an occasional oribi there
seemed to be no other variety of antelope in our vicinity. Bushfowl
and guinea-fowl were very plentiful, and it was never necessary to
resort to the tough, skinny fowl which so often forms the staple
article of diet for the white traveller in West Africa. My
luxuries, such as whisky and sugar, had by this time run out, but
thanks to a good supply of flour, the faithful Mamadu was always
able to bake me plenty of bread. With that and an abundant supply
of fresh meat and milk I fared none too badly for the bush.</p>

<p>On the 19th of February we reached the large, important village
of Kangaba, called sometimes Kaba. This was the first place of any
size in the French Soudan, although the actual boundary between it
and French Guinea was close to the spot where I had crossed the
Niger.</p>

<p>I have several times used the expression “French Soudan,” and
feel it perhaps requires some explanation. It is a name the French
have given, in a very broad sense, to the whole of that vast
territory which comes into their sphere of influence from Lake Chad
to the Senegal River, and bounded on the south by the coast
colonies of Guinea, Ivory Coast and Dahomey, while the northern
limit is the Sahara Desert. The western portion of this country is
officially known as the “Upper Senegal and Niger Colony,” and this
extends from Niafounké on the Niger, south-west of Timbuctu, to the
Senegal River on the west.</p>

<p>The colony is divided up into a number of administrative
districts, and, of course, covering as it does such a
large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span> area, the
races who inhabit it are of many different types and shades.
Kangaba is a walled town with a population of 2000 inhabitants. The
walls, which were built in the time of the Sofa wars, are now
crumbling to pieces as they are not kept in repair. They are built
of red clay, which is found in quantities in these parts. The walls
are still in some places twenty feet high and five to six feet
thick. There are four gateways, one at each main point of the
compass. The wall has been constructed out of the clay excavated
from a big ditch running round the town. The ditch is now filled in
in many places. Kaba stands on the southern slope of a hill,
commanding a fine view of the Niger valley towards Bamako. The
other sides of this hill and the plain leading down to the river on
the east are covered with farms of Guinea corn, rice and millet.
Kangaba is divided into three villages. The main one is the market
for all the trade following the Bamako-Siguiri road. Between it and
the Niger there are two other smaller villages. The nearest of
these is the farming village, in which live many of the cultivators
of the local crops. The third village is almost on the Niger banks,
at least three miles from the market, and here the fisherfolk
live.</p>

<p>I had great hope of being able to pick up a passing trading
barge here which would give me a lift to Bamako. But at the time
there was unfortunately none on the river.</p>

<p>My “boy” was very sore-footed and doleful when we reached Kaba,
informing me that he could not walk any farther without a rest. He
really was going rather lame, but was suffering more from want of
pluck than fatigue, I fancy. It had certainly been very hot on the
march, particularly during the past few days; also we had marched
continually since leaving Falama, and some of the days had been
long ones. However, I decided to make one day’s halt to let him
rest, and at the same time to arrange<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_112">[112]</span> for fresh carriers. Mamadu came to ask me
for an advance of pay, going off in great jubilation to the market
to spend on fineries the ten francs I gave him. He was no exception
to the ordinary West African native, who is inordinately vain and
lavishes all his money on dress.</p>

<p>The chief of the town was full of protestations of hospitality,
and nothing would satisfy him but that I should live in his house.
He and his family turned out, going to a hut near by. The old man
was evidently of a kindly disposition, for I soon discovered to my
cost that his hut was a right-of-way for all kinds of domestic
animals. In the early morning I would be awaked by the lowing of a
cow as she casually sauntered through my bedroom on her way to the
pastures outside the village. The same animal paid me a visit one
night while I was having a bath after my evening’s shoot. On that
occasion she seemed in no hurry to go away, appearing fully to
realize the advantage of her position while I was bathing! My
cries, intended to frighten her, were treated with silent contempt.
When I flicked handfuls of water at her she merely started to lick
that portion of her anatomy which had suffered a wetting. Finally,
I had to call my “boy” to drive out the offending beast. When the
chief was given orders to prevent a recurrence of the annoyance, he
gently replied that he was sure the “missi” (Malinké word for
“cow”) meant no harm. Besides the cow, numerous pigs, goats and
fowls used to make my room a daily promenade. The only way out of
the trouble was to blockade the doors. I finally chartered two
small boys whose duty it was to sit, one at either doorway, and
drive away any offender which attempted to force an entrance.</p>

<p>At night the market was a picturesque scene. Innumerable tiny
stalls, each lit up by a small native lamp or flare burning
ground-nut oil, were dotted about. At each sat a woman, disposing
of her wares. The articles<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_113">[113]</span> for sale included fish, different kinds of
native diet and fruit. But more interesting to the European were
the vendors of such articles as grass mats, country cloths, gold
ornaments made by the local smith out of Siguiri gold, also balls
of rubber and bars of native salt. While the women mostly sat
quietly selling, the men wandered about in groups of two and three,
chattering and smiling as they strolled along, giving to the whole
scene more the aspect of a promenade taken for amusement than for
the sake of buying anything. Occasionally, however, one of these
tall figures, clothed in a white Mohammedan gown, would stop in
front of a stall and ask the price of some object he fancied. This
usually was the preliminary to a great deal of haggling, and in the
end the article was probably sold for about half the price
originally asked.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw3" id="i09"><img src="images/i09.jpg" alt=

<div>
<p class="sc">The Spread of Islam in the Western Soudan</p>

<p class="justify">A Malinké chief and his followers in their
Mohammedan robes illustrate the influence the religion of “the
Prophet” has gained of recent years in these regions; for this
dress is the hall-mark of the Mussulman in West Africa. A wave of
Mohammedanism has swept rapidly and steadily westward from Egypt
across some three thousand miles of the African continent during
the last century. Apart from the consternation this causes in the
hearts of those who are endeavouring to establish Christianity in
the Dark Continent, serious thinkers are not lacking who view with
alarm the possibilities of an African “holy war” in the future.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Bargaining is a feature of all transactions among natives, and
necessarily so, for the seller goes on the principle of asking
about double the value of his wares in the hopes that he will get
it, and secure in the knowledge that he can, if required, reduce
the amount by one half and yet not lose.</p>

<p>On the 21st I started off once more, hoping that this time, as
we were out of the wildest bush, I should have no further trouble
with carriers. Things in this particular respect were, to my
disgust, worse than before. Along the high road to Bamako villages
were now strewed at close intervals. Having gaily started off with
eight picked porters of sturdy build, I was congratulating myself
that they would take my loads along at a fine pace to Bamako, and I
need no further worry myself about them. Misfortune visited me at
the first village, however, where my servant came to report that
the carriers wanted to be paid and changed! We had not walked more
than four miles, so it was rather trying to my temper to hear this
piece of news.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
</p>

<p>Haranguing was of not the slightest use, and one and all
proceeded to slope away into some friendly hut or other convenient
place of refuge. I summoned the chief and made him send for a fresh
gang at once. After infinite delay I got started on the road once
more, but did not reach my halting-place till late that night,
after many similar vexatious delays <i>en route</i>. The numerous
villages on the way made the task of keeping the carriers faithful
doubly hard, they appearing to think that their duty was only to
carry from their township to the next one. After this experience I
decided to abandon the attempt of keeping my porters even for one
day, since no promises of high pay nor any amount of argument
seemed to produce an effect. I now arranged with the chief, or
headman, of the village where I spent the night to supply carriers
to the next village only; at the same time he was told to warn the
headman of that village that I would require fresh men ready at the
hour of my arrival the following day. The latter in his turn was
ordered to inform the succeeding village of my requirements, and
thus I laid a “dak” of porters for the whole of the morrow’s march.
This plan, although not an ideal one, I found worked better than
the previous arrangement, and I adhered to it for the rest of the
journey. The chief drawback to it was the loss of time
involved.</p>

<p>If I ordered my new carriers to be ready at a certain village at
a certain hour, the chief of the place, with the native’s
delightful disregard of punctuality, would frequently not think of
sending for his gang until I hove in sight. Time is no object to
the negro, and he can never understand why it is a matter of any
importance to the white man. Of course, these people have no
watches, and their only way of illustrating time is to point to the
position the sun will approximately occupy in the sky at that hour.
Even that is not generally reliable within<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_115">[115]</span> less than three hours. Often when marching
to an unknown spot have I asked my guide where the sun will be in
the heavens when we arrive, and he has buoyed up my hopes of an
early arrival by indicating three o’clock, whereas we have not
arrived till about six in the evening.</p>

<p>That night, on entering the halting-place, I noticed a white man
standing in the market. He was a French trader who had just
arrived, like myself, but from the opposite side of the Niger,
where he had been to buy rubber for his firm. I asked him to give
me the pleasure of his company at dinner, when we would celebrate
the meeting of two white men in the bush. The last European I had
seen was at Kankan, a comparatively short time ago, but this trader
had been in the wilds for six months without a sight of a white
face, he informed me. We had a very pleasant evening together, and
I produced the only kind of alcohol that remained for the
festivity. It was a small bottle of rum, a part of my medicine
stores, and we drank to the <i>entente cordiale</i> in a glass of
that!</p>

<p>My new acquaintance gave me some interesting information about
the trade of the country. He said the rubber trade did not now pay
as well as it used to do, for the natives were no longer content
with a few beads or looking-glasses in exchange for their produce
as had been the case a few years, or even months, ago. They now
would only take cash, and demanded a far higher value for the
rubber. We conversed on many topics of mutual interest and it was
with regret that I bade him good-bye when he got up to leave.</p>

<p>Owing to the open nature of the country the marches were hotter
even than before. In the middle of the day, when halting for a meal
and a rest, one was plagued by myriads of small midges. These
little insects are not to be seen when you are on the march, but as
soon as you make a halt in the shade they spring up, from goodness
knows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span> where, in an
incredibly short time, buzzing round your face in a most
distracting fashion. They do not bite, but have a nasty habit of
getting into your eyes, down your ears, and in your mouth and nose
if you give them half a chance. I don’t think I have ever been so
worried by flies as I was here. Flicking with a handkerchief only
seems to increase the fury of their onslaughts without visibly
diminishing the number of your tormentors. The only remedy is to
abandon the shade you had been so thankful to seek, and, if rest
you must, sit in the sun as far from shady trees as possible. After
about 4 p.m. these miniature demons seem to disappear, no doubt
exhausted with their ceaseless activity of the daytime, and seeking
a much-needed rest.</p>

<p>Two trees must be mentioned which grow in profusion here; one is
the “shea-butter,” and the other the “African oak” (mentioned
above). The former, called in Mandingo or Malinké “shi,” and known
to the French as the “carité,” grows about the size of an ordinary
apple tree. The leaves are a refreshing emerald-green, and its
graceful spreading branches and silver-grey trunk make it one of
the most picturesque flora of the landscape. The fruit ripens about
September or October. It is then picked and buried in the earth,
where it is allowed to remain till it rots. It is then crushed with
stones, and the oil which is expressed by this process is boiled.
The resulting substance is what is commercially called
“shea-butter.” It has in this form a greyish-white colour, and is
made up into balls or small blocks for convenience of
transport.</p>

<p>Shea-butter has several uses. It is first and foremost used by
the natives as a cooking ingredient. The native is extremely found
of oily dishes, consequently shea-butter takes a prominent part in
all his culinary recipes. The odour of the butter, when cooking, is
quite one of the most unpleasant it has been my misfortune to meet
with in Africa. To my mind it is so disgusting that I can think
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span> nothing in
England with which to compare it, and I feel convinced that any
comparison would be inadequate, only being an insult to the English
article! But in spite of its unpleasant smell it is only fair to
say that it is invaluable to the native in a country where oil of
any description is scarce. The oil is also used for lighting
purposes, in the same way as ground-nut oil. Small flares of
shea-butter are used for the house or market at night. The method
is simple in the extreme. A piece of wood, or a bit of the bark of
a tree, is scooped out so as to form a tiny hollow vessel, and the
butter is poured into this. Wick is manufactured out of the fibres
of a palm, and is steeped in the butter and lighted. This primitive
little night-light is very serviceable and does not blow out easily
in a wind. Shea-butter is now exported to Europe, where the oil is
in some demand for making cart-grease and coarse lubricants. The
export trade of the French Soudan in this article is increasing.
The trees require practically no attention, growing wild in the
bush in certain localities where the soil and climate are
favourable.</p>

<p>The other tree mentioned above is called in Mandingo
“Mannagézé.” It also is very abundant in this part of the Soudan.
It has a pretty white flower, with a delicious smell like a
magnolia. The tree flowers through a great part of the dry weather.
The small twigs of this tree, which grows to a height of thirty or
forty feet, are used by the natives for cleaning their teeth. The
bark or skin is first peeled off and the teeth are then rubbed with
the exposed portion of the wood. It has a bitter taste, not
unpleasant, which remains in the mouth for some time after the
teeth have been cleaned. In the early morning it is a very ordinary
sight to see every carrier chewing one of these sticks as he walks,
and when his load is laid on the ground he will start to use it
much in the same way as one uses a toothbrush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
</p>

<p>Walking along thus, and covering twenty to twenty-five miles a
day, we reached Bamako on the 23rd of February. We were now about
400 miles from the source of the river, and since leaving the
railway at Pendembu I had walked over 600 miles, almost without a
whole day’s repose, for when I had halted I had usually been out
shooting from early morning till evening, so I was glad of the
thoughts of a rest. During the last thirty miles of the march a low
range of hills appeared on the west; this was the edge of the Kati
Plateau. This plateau stretches for some miles towards the Bafing
River, and is a striking feature of the scenery near Bamako, for it
dominates the town on this side, while the surrounding country is
by contrast very flat and low-lying.</p>

<p>The road gradually approaches the Niger on the east, being
intersected by numerous small rivulets flowing in sparkling crystal
streams from the Kati Plateau to the big river.</p>

<p>The last ten miles or more are a vast expanse of cultivated
land. Rich rice and millet fields stretch as far as the eye can
reach in either direction, towards the Niger on one side and to the
foot of the plateau on the other. This is the heart of a
rice-growing district for the big markets which depend on Bamako
for their annual supplies of food. The busy farmers of this region
are prosperous and appear happy and contented, as they well
may.</p>

<p>We arrived at Bamako a strange-looking party. I was tanned a
deep brown colour from long exposure to the fierce sun of the
Soudan. My clothes were luckily khaki, or the state of my garments
would have been even more noticeable than it actually was. I was
much in need of a thorough overhaul and repair! Mamadu was in a far
worse plight than his master; his long, white robe and white, baggy
trousers were in rags, and certainly looked as if they had been any
colour but white even in their<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_119">[119]</span> palmiest days. Small wonder that the good
people of Bamako were astonished at the strange figures they saw
entering the town that afternoon. Crowds of small boys and idlers
turned out to watch and follow our small caravan as it wended its
way slowly into the big market-place. I am sure we must have looked
like some wild men from the woods!</p>

<p>With some difficulty I got someone to show me the road to the
Commissioner’s bungalow, where I was anxious to report myself
before finding a lodging-place.</p>

market — The hotel.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE first sight of Bamako to the traveller is,
indeed, a strange one. After walking through miles upon miles of
bush and seeing nothing more imposing than a native village, one
suddenly is amazed to behold a fine large town, with wide
boulevards and solidly built stone houses, nestling close to the
foot of the Kati Escarpment, with the placid waters of the Niger
flowing past the east end of the cantonment. Bamako is planned on
the lines of a town in France, and when walking down one of the
shady avenues I could have imagined myself in a provincial French
town on a hot summer’s day. Bamako is the capital of the “Upper
Senegal and Niger Colony,” and the head-quarters of the
Lieutenant-Governor and Administration. The European population is
a large one. It includes no less than fifteen trading firms, each
of which has several French employés. There are a very large number
of officials, and several of the staff of the Senegal-Niger
Railway. A number of these gentlemen bring their wives to the
country.</p>

<p>When I was at Bamako there were about a dozen ladies, who were
very excited at the prospect of a fancy-dress ball which was to
take place shortly. It was very surprising to find such
civilization in the middle of the Western Soudan, and the town is a
testimony to the energy of the French administration in West
Africa. The houses now<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_121">[121]</span> being built have two storeys and fine wide
verandahs; water will be laid on to each one and the streets will
soon be lighted by electricity. I was directed to the
Commissioner’s bungalow, a well-built house in the centre of the
town. He received me with all the courteous solicitude which the
French nation so peculiarly knows how to show to the foreigner.
After he had given me all possible assistance and information, I
was invited to <i>déjeuner</i> the following Saturday and shown the
way to the hotel where I was to stay.</p>

<p>Having sent on my kit, I proceeded to the offices of the French
Company, the trading firm which had arranged my money affairs for
me at Sierra Leone. Here I was introduced to the agent, a most
agreeable Frenchman, with whom I had a conversation about the funds
which had been deposited with him in my favour. I had calculated
the money I required for my journey from Freetown to Bamako to a
nicety, and was very glad to be now able to draw a further supply.
Here, also, it was necessary to arrange for further drafts to be
made payable to me at Timbuctu or some place down the Niger, close
to my intended starting-point for the desert. Unfortunately the
French Company had no branches open in the Soudan on the route I
proposed to follow, and I foresaw difficulties looming ahead if I
should be obliged to carry large sums on my person or in my loads.
My chief fear was on the score of robbers. Having no escort, and
not having too much faith in my servant’s honesty, it seemed highly
imprudent to carry with me more cash than was absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p>However, my friend the agent was most obliging and promised to
try to arrange matters for me with another firm which had a house
at Timbuctu. It may come as a surprise to some people to hear that
French trading firms do actually exist at this point, which, I must
acknowledge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span> to me
had always seemed like a mythical place rather than a reality. But
so it was. Two or three enterprising firms had pushed hundreds of
miles down the Niger, anxious to be the first to tap the trade of
this little-known region.</p>

<p>I had decided after my talk with the Commissioner to take the
train from Bamako to Koulikoro, and at that point to embark on the
Niger. There were two alternatives open to me, either to charter my
own barge, or to take a passage on a Government launch. If there
was sufficient water in the river the latter would be the quicker
way, and therefore the most advantageous for me. On the other hand,
should the river be very low I should do better to sail and pole
down-stream in the barge, which draws considerably less water than
the launch. I therefore wired to the offices of the Niger
Navigation at Koulikoro asking which would be the surest and
quickest kind of transport to take. The following day the reply
came advising me to take passage on a launch which would leave
about the 1st of March.</p>

<p>At Bamako the roads are excellent and horses numerous, so that
many people possess a vehicle and drive a good deal. Of course,
most of the traps come out from France, but I saw one or two which
had been locally made and were first-rate copies of the French
model. So far motor-cars have not been introduced, but I have not
the least doubt that they will shortly make their appearance in
this go-ahead African town. The roads are quite good enough, and I
was informed that most of the bridges would require but little
strengthening for this purpose. One afternoon I went for a stroll
towards the river. On the way I passed through the native town,
which is kept in spick-and-span order like the rest of Bamako.</p>

<p>The people are mostly Bambaras, another large offshoot of the
Mandingo tribe. Bambaras are an intelligent race, and possibly the
most industrious of all the races of the French Soudan. Large
numbers are recruited for the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_123">[123]</span> French West African troops, as they have a
great reputation for pluck and endurance. The same tribe furnishes
the best river boatmen, and Bambaras are found plying such varied
trades as the shoemaker’s and the blacksmith’s. They are scattered
in more or less big groups all along the Niger from Bamako to
Mopti, and large numbers inhabit the countries about Nioro and
Sokolo on the left bank of the river, stretching towards the
desert. The men and women have fine physique, they are usually tall
and thick-set, but rather clumsy in build. The women are very vain
about their appearance generally, and their hair in particular. The
<i>coiffure</i> is decidedly elaborate. There are two fashions in
vogue. The hair is drawn up tight from the forehead and built upon
the top of the head in a sort of ridge shape; this curious form is
obtained by placing a framework underneath. The second method is to
twist the hair into numerous plaits, which are arranged
fantastically around the ears and allowed to hang down over the
face. Gold ear-rings and silver rings are much worn by the
well-to-do classes, while sham pearl necklaces are in great demand
as ornaments for these dusky beauties.</p>

<div>
<p class="sc">The Railway Station and Hotel at Bamako</p>

<p class="justify">Bamako is certainly the most important place in
the French Soudan. Being connected with the Niger and Senegal
rivers by rail, it has direct communication with the Atlantic Ocean
on the one side, and with the fertile rice-growing areas of the
Middle Niger on the other, thus making it a great <i>entrepôt</i>
of the trade in these regions.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter iw2" id="i11"><img src="images/i11.jpg" alt=

<div>
<p class="sc">The Niger at Bamako</p>

<p class="justify">A special interest attaches to the Niger here as
far as the traveller from the south is concerned. At Bamako for the
first time he can discard that clumsy, however useful, form of
transport—the native porter. Thirty-five short miles of railway
join Bamako to Koulikoro, and then the Niger is uninterruptedly
navigable by stern-wheeler, launch, or canoe for about 900 miles to
Ansongo.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The men and women are of a cheerful, light-hearted disposition,
and it is seldom that these charming people have not a ready joke
and smile on their lips by way of welcome to the stranger. Having
passed through the native quarter, I saw in front of me several
acres of banana groves, the long graceful leaves blending in the
distance with the darker green foliage of orange and lime trees.
Besides many kinds of fruit the Government grow quantities of
vegetables with which the whole station is supplied; I was told
that there is a never-failing supply from one year’s end to the
other.</p>

<p>The scene on the banks of the Niger was an interesting one. A
ferry was plying from the opposite bank towards<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span> me, in which were a number of
passengers hurrying across before nightfall. Here and there, on the
broad bosom of the river, were scattered native canoes with their
quaint awnings of palm and banana leaves, looking like some big,
brown bird floating on the water. The banks of the Niger are low
and sandy here, and on the shore were gathered a little knot of
spectators from the town, talking and watching the arrival of the
ferry, while, as the sun was sinking in a flood of red and gold
behind the Kati Hills, those who were devout worshippers of the
Prophet sank to their knees and could be heard muttering in low,
musical tones the cry “Allahu Akbar.” To my mind it is an
impressive sight to watch the pious Mohammedan at this hour forsake
the occupation upon which he is engaged, prostrating himself with
his face turned eastward towards the holy city of Mecca, forgetful
for the time of worldly matters, but devoting his thoughts and
prayers to his God.</p>

<p>I stood a silent spectator of the peaceful scene until the fiery
sun had disappeared behind the distant hills and darkness began to
descend with its customary swiftness on the face of the land,
blotting out the water and craft from my vision. I must be hurrying
back, as I had promised to dine with one of my new friends that
night, so I regretfully turned away from the Niger and set my face
homewards. That night I had a bad attack of fever, being obliged to
leave my host early and retire to a bed, piled with blankets, for
the next twenty-four hours. The reaction after my hard marching was
probably now telling on me, and I had also a touch of the sun, I
fancy. Hot lime drinks and some judicious doses of quinine and
phenacetin soon did their work, and, although feeling rather limp,
I was myself once more.</p>

<p>In the meantime I had heard from the agent of the French Company
that he had been able to arrange for a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_125">[125]</span> draft on Timbuctu for me, so, my business
being settled, I was at liberty to pass the rest of my time at
Bamako as I pleased.</p>

<p>I had two duties to perform, one was to pay an official call on
the Governor, the other being to visit the Colonel and officers of
the garrison at Kati.</p>

<p>Having been lent a horse by the Commissioner I decided to ride
to Kati, which was on the Kati Plateau, about eight miles off.
Before starting, however, I received a wire from the Colonel,
asking me to have <i>déjeuner</i> with them, so I postponed my
departure till a later hour that morning, intending to visit the
Governor on my way back to the town in the afternoon. My steed was
a flea-bitten grey pony about 14.2 h.h., which had not been out of
the stables for some days, so I had an interested audience to watch
my departure, as they informed me he was <i>très méchant!</i> As we
started down the road my mount showed a decided desire to return to
stables, commencing operations by shying and then standing up on
his hind legs while he executed a kind of war dance. I think the
spectators had their money’s worth of fun before we finally got
under way and set out at a gentle trot for Kati.</p>

<p>The road was a capital one, skirting for a couple of miles along
the foot of the hills and then across the railway, gradually
climbing the slope by gentle gradients. As we climbed we left the
burnt-up, khaki-coloured plain behind and rose into a landscape of
green verdure and sparkling streams. Many small torrents came
headlong down the hill-side, their rocky beds giving birth to
iridescent cascades, around which hovered beautiful, many-coloured
butterflies. Up and up we climbed until the summit was reached, and
I drew rein to admire the view spread out before my eyes. The
well-watered green slopes of the hills stretched away to the north
and west as far as one could see; below me I could just catch a
glimpse of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
railway—the metal rails looking like a gleaming snake as they
twisted about following the contours of the hill. To my right I
beheld some whitewashed buildings glistening in the sun, evidently
the cantonments of the Kati garrison.</p>

<p>The horse-boy now arrived, panting and breathless from the
climb, so after waiting a moment to give him time to recover, I
made my way slowly towards the houses. On my arrival I had to
apologize for the shortcomings of my wardrobe, for, of course, I
had not been able to bring any uniform on my expedition, and my
hosts were all attired in smart, white tunics in honour of the
advent of a British officer. The Colonel was a fine-looking,
stalwart soldier, who had a splendid record of service in West
Africa, and was wearing the cross of the Legion of Honour. That
luncheon-party was the merriest one I had attended for a long time,
and, after many weeks of my own society since leaving Freetown, it
was very enjoyable to be among such cheery companions. The officers
at Kati can get by train to Bamako nearly every day if they wish,
but their duties keep them fairly busy in garrison, they informed
me. They have a pleasant little colony at their station and the
joys of social life at Bamako did not apparently appeal to them
greatly. As a matter of fact, the Europeans at the capital of the
Soudan are divided rather strangely into three groups. The traders
and the administrative officials of the district of Bamako are all
quartered in the town, and, as has been explained, the troops and
military officers are at Kati, while the administrative officials
of the colony are at a place called Koulouba, which is on a hill
three miles from the town. The officers were most anxious for me to
spend the afternoon with them, but it was half-past three before we
finished the sumptuous repast which had been prepared for us, and I
had an eight-mile ride to Government House at Koulouba in front of
me.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant-Governor of the colony had been away<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span> touring and only returned the
previous day, so I was fortunate in being able to make his
acquaintance before leaving Bamako. Government House is a splendid
stone mansion, situated on the edge of the plateau, overlooking the
town of Bamako and commanding a fine view over the Niger, which can
be seen like a silver thread winding its way north-east towards
KouliKoro.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant-Governor’s residence is truly a palace. It is
three storeys high, and has large rooms and cool, wide verandahs
and corridors. The house is furnished in the most comfortable, if
not luxurious, style, and I had no difficulty in believing the
statement that it was the finest house in French West Africa. I
have seen no building in British West Africa which could in any way
be compared to it. It is said to have cost a million francs to
build, as all the material had to be brought from Europe. Electric
light and hot water are laid on everywhere, and no effort seems to
have been spared to make the place a model of comfort and
elegance.</p>

<p>The houses of the officials who are on the Lieutenant-Governor’s
staff are also admirably fitted up. Water is a great difficulty on
the top of the hill, but this has been overcome by installing an
apparatus for pumping it up from the Niger below.</p>

<p>A capital carriage-road leads down the hill to Bamako, and there
is also an excellent bridle-path. The Lieutenant-Governor had his
wife and family at Koulouba. I was told that they proposed to spend
a whole year in the country, as they found life so agreeable and
comfortable at Government House.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant-Governor received me very graciously, supplying
me with all the maps and information I required. He also promised
to telegraph down the Niger, sending instructions for every
facility to be given me where I wanted to shoot. In the course of
conversation I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
rather astonished when he inquired after my two companions. I
informed him that I was travelling alone and had no companions,
whereupon he showed me a letter referring to the projected visit of
three Englishmen to Bamako, who were engaged on a scientific and
hunting expedition in the Western Soudan. He naturally thought that
I was one of this party. I had, however, never heard of them. It
was certainly a strange coincidence that another party of
Englishmen should be contemplating a trip in this region about the
same time as myself, more especially as Englishmen very rarely
visit the country. I never met this party, and am not aware if they
ever started on their proposed tour.</p>

<p>At Government House I was introduced to one of the secretaries,
who, I was told, had served in the “Bend” of the Niger, where I
wished to shoot, and would be able to give me information on the
subject of the game in that locality. I was delighted at the
opportunity of getting some reliable, first-hand news. The
gentleman I was introduced to had been in the heart of the country
I intended to visit for five years, he informed me, and was a keen
sportsman, so I was in great luck to meet him here. He advised me
to disembark at a place called Niafounké, nearly 500 miles
down-river, and from there to strike into the district of
Bandiagara, where big game of many varieties was plentiful. He also
gave me letters of introduction to the French officials of the
districts through which I should pass, and informed me of the best
hunters to be obtained at the villages in the region to which I was
proceeding. His information was most valuable, and I was overjoyed
to hear his glowing accounts of the shooting available in the
“Boucle,” as the French call the Big “Bend” of the Niger. He, like
most Frenchmen who shoot in West Africa, had used nothing but the
Lebel rifle, which has a calibre but little bigger than the ·303.
I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span> cannot help
thinking that a great deal of game must be wounded when such a
small-bore rifle is relied upon for the bigger animals, and, quite
apart from the danger to the individual who is shooting, to my mind
it is cruel to wound a beast which you are unable to overtake and
kill owing to the rifle being a less powerful weapon than should be
used.</p>

<p>My new friend invited me to his quarters, where we had a long
and interesting conversation about shooting in West Africa. Later
in the evening we descended the hill together to Bamako, whither he
was riding. We made an appointment for the following day in order
to continue our conversation, but unfortunately it fell
through.</p>

<p>The Senegal-Niger Railway forms one of the links forged by the
French for penetrating into the Western Soudan from the coast. The
River Senegal is the first link in the chain. From the port of St.
Louis, on the Atlantic coast and at the mouth of the Senegal River,
this waterway is navigable at certain times of the year for big
steamers as far as the town of Kayes. This town is situated about
400 miles up the stream. Above Kayes the Senegal River is not
navigable, and until Koulikoro is reached the Niger is not
navigable, although from that point downwards the river is
navigable for many hundred miles. Now to connect these two
waterways, the Senegal and the Niger, it became necessary to join
the towns of Kayes and Koulikoro by a railway. The French thus
completed a line of communication from St. Louis on the sea-coast
to the heart of the Western Soudan.</p>

<p>Although the Senegal River is navigable as far as Kayes, this is
only the case during certain months of the year. For instance,
during the rainy season, from about July to November, ships of 2000
tons can ascend to this point. Small steamers, launches and
stern-wheelers can proceed to Kayes until the month of February,
but from February till June the river is only navigable by canoes
with difficulty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span> In
consequence of this the Senegal River is rather a weak point in the
chain of communication with the interior. To remedy this the French
are now building a fresh line from Dakar, the new capital of the
Senegal Colony and head-quarters of the Governor-General of French
West Africa, to Kayes. About half of this railway is completed. The
line is well-laid and the work of construction is in very capable
hands, so there is no doubt it will be finished as quickly as
possible. The saving of time will be enormous; for, in the dry
season, when it takes about a month to reach the coast by the
present route from Kayes, it will in future only take two days by
rail. The train, which runs three or four times a week in each
direction, takes two days to go from Bamako to Kayes. The carriages
are fairly comfortable, and the railway is much used by natives,
who take a childish delight in travelling by train.</p>

<p>The trade of the colony has benefited greatly by the
Senegal-Niger line, the output of ground nuts for export to France
having particularly shown a large increase. Trains run nearly every
day from Bamako to Koulikoro, a distance of only thirty-five miles.
The third-class carriages are not uncomfortable. I travelled a
short distance in one myself. Some of the compartments extend along
the whole length of the carriage, having the two ends open, which
makes travelling in the hot weather much cooler than it would
otherwise be. Railways in French West Africa are being rapidly
constructed, and it is probable that in the next decade the
Senegal-Niger, or the Guinea line, will be continued across the
French Soudan to the east of the “Bend” of the Niger, and that the
existing branches in the colonies of Ivory Coast and Dahomey will
be extended northwards to meet it.</p>

<p>The last morning of my stay at Bamako I paid a visit to the
market with my “boy.” I suppose it is the largest<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span> and most thriving market of
the Western Soudan. The produce of the large rice and millet farms
of the Niger is brought here for sale, and this comes not only from
the district around Bamako, but also from the big grain areas in
the Macina province, some 350 miles farther down the river. Ground
nuts, which are so extensively grown in the colony, form a large
proportion of the produce of the market. But in addition to grains
almost every article of trade in the Soudan is brought here. The
same heterogeneous collection of different races which I had
noticed at Kankan was to be seen, but the proportion of pale-faced,
Jewish-looking Moors was larger, while occasionally a stalwart Arab
in flowing white robes would show conspicuously amongst the swarthy
negroid tribesmen.</p>

<p>A great feature of the Bamako market is the part devoted to
dairy produce. There are two distinct portions in this section. One
has preserved milk, butter, etc., or in other words, stuff which
has been brought from the north of the Niger in goatskins and is
invariably rancid. The other portion contains fresh milk and
butter. The butter is made up in tiny round pats, which are allowed
to float in the calabashes of milk displayed for sale. Most natives
prefer the “preserved” dairy produce, for sour butter and curdled
milk are things which the soul of the Bambara loveth, probably
finding their flavour more piquant, and condemning the fresh
articles as insipid.</p>

<p>In another corner was the live stock. Fine humped cattle from
the Niger valley, Soudan sheep from the lake-country in the “Bend,”
many of which had thick coats of fleecy white wool, and goats from
anywhere and everywhere were huddled up indiscriminately together.
The horses were all of the same type. The 14 or 14.2 pony of the
Soudan rather resembles the Barb pony, but is weedier in
appearance; although, from my own observation, I should back the
Soudan animal to beat his Barb<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_132">[132]</span> confrère in a trial of endurance. I was
told that camels occasionally came down to Bamako, but personally I
never saw one there. The camel caravan routes nearly all stop on
the north of the Niger and Senegal rivers. I fancy these animals
are rarely brought across, partly on account of the danger
attending the transportation of such unwieldy brutes, and partly
because the river-water is said to produce some kind of sickness
from which a camel seldom recovers. In any case, there does not
appear to be any advantage in introducing camel transport into a
well-watered country.</p>

<p>The hotel at Bamako is close to the railway station; it also
possesses a buffet for the use of passengers. This was one of the
several surprises which I had on my arrival at the town, for it had
never entered my calculations to find an hotel in this remote
region. There are two storeys, with four bedrooms on each floor.
The dining-room is spacious, and can easily accommodate twenty
people. In the afternoon, when the sun is getting low, small tables
are placed in the compound in front of the building, and here
people congregate to talk over the events of the day while drinking
their cognac or cup of coffee, for all the world like
restaurant-life in the boulevards of a town in France.</p>

<p>At this hour the tables were generally full, the Frenchman being
a sociable person and dearly loving this daily meeting with his
friends at the restaurant. In the evening, when the lamps are
lighted, two or three card-tables are made up. I noticed that even
there bridge seemed to be as popular a game as it is with us. There
is a small menagerie in the hotel garden, containing two ostriches
and a few other wild animals. It was a strange sight to see the
former animals strutting about in their lordly fashion, and, with
their extraordinary powers of digestion, occasionally picking up
and swallowing a stone in the calmest way imaginable.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="chap_sum">Koulikoro — Niger Navigation Service — Rapids
on the Niger — The Hourst Expedition — An explorer’s death —
Horse-breeding.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the 27th of February I left by the morning
train for Koulikoro. The director of the eastern section of the
Senegal-Niger Railway, to whom I was introduced, travelled down in
the same carriage. Commandant Digue is a most interesting man, with
a vast experience of railways in West Africa, and possessing a
reputation for great energy and ability. He was formerly an officer
of Engineers, but has now retired from the French Army. In the
early days of the railway construction many brave men laid down
their lives while overcoming the engineering difficulties which had
to be faced, and he is one of the few survivors of those hard
times.</p>

<p>The line runs through a grassy bush-country a few miles from the
left bank of the Niger, and occasionally the passenger catches a
glimpse of that river as it twists and turns on its north-easterly
course. The train was a slow one, taking three hours to cover the
thirty-five miles and stopping at every station. On approaching
Koulikoro the country becomes more hilly on the north and west,
while the river is gradually seen more distinctly on the east. For
West Africa the station is a large and busy one. In the railway
yard there are repairing shops with skilled workmen capable of
carrying out almost any work that is necessary. There are a large
amount of rolling stock and a big engine-shed. The day was Sunday,
so our train contained several Europeans who had come over from
Bamako<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span> to spend the
day with friends here. Several people were on the platform awaiting
our arrival; amongst them the local railway officials in white
uniform were conspicuous, having come to meet the director of the
line.</p>

<p>We went up to the hotel, where I took a room and installed
myself for the next two days. This hotel is similar to the one at
Bamako, but is more comfortable and a good deal cleaner. The hotels
were built by Government and are the property of the railway, but
are let to private individuals, who are responsible for the entire
management, and charge their own prices. One of my
fellow-passengers that morning was a French officer coming down on
duty to Koulikoro. We made friends in the train and he had promised
to call for me in the afternoon to take me to visit the Director of
the Niger Navigation Service. About four o’clock we set out on our
visit. The official in question was at home with his wife and two
daughters. Madame was a charming lady from Algeria, and she and her
daughters had but lately returned from an adventurous trip down the
Niger to its farthest navigable point, a place called Ansongo, a
distance of about 900 miles. They told me they were the first white
women ever to visit Ansongo, and I can well believe that few ladies
would care to risk the dangers and hardships of such a voyage.</p>

<p>My new friend, Lieutenant Langel, sang us some most amusing
songs to the accompaniment of one of the young ladies, and finally
had only just time to catch the evening train back to Bamako. M.
Langel, although only a lieutenant, had seen a considerable amount
of service in West Africa, having commenced life there in the
ranks. He had a large fund of funny anecdotes about the country and
was as pleasant a companion as can be imagined. I was indebted to
him for introductions to several influential officials it was my
pleasure to meet later during my travels.</p>

<p class="justify">This is a prosperous town, where a good deal of
tobacco and cotton are grown. Near Ségou we encountered the worst
sandbanks of the voyage. In places the channel was not eighteen
inches deep, and we had considerable difficulty in passing.</p>

</p>

<p>After the departure of the train an adjournment was made to the
hotel, where I met the Resident of Koulikoro and his wife. A
tennis-court had been made in the gardens, and it was decided to
play. I don’t think I have ever played the game under such strange
conditions as I have here. The net was locally made out of native
fishing-nets, the ground was the flattest piece of rock we could
find, with the court-lines marked out in white chalk, while the
balls were of ordinary india-rubber, and no one possessed
tennis-shoes. The racquets were, or rather had once been,
tennis-bats, and were the only part of our equipment resembling the
real article. However, it was an amusing game, causing almost as
much merriment to the players as it did to the spectators. After
tennis we all assembled at little tables in front of the hotel, as
the custom is, to take an <i>apéritif</i>. Besides myself there
were only three men staying at the hotel; these were permanent
residents, who were employed in the Government Offices and found it
more convenient to live at the hotel than to have a separate
establishment in the town.</p>

<p>As I previously mentioned, the terminus of the railway and the
head-quarters of the Niger Navigation Service are here,
consequently there is a large number of European officials employed
at Koulikoro. The navigation service is entirely controlled by the
Government. There are several stern-wheelers, small steam-launches,
steel canoes and barges in the fleet. These vary considerably in
size and comfort. The depth of the Niger alters greatly according
to the season of the year. At certain times during the dry season
there is so little water in parts of the Upper Niger that
navigation even by shallow-draught barges is exceedingly
difficult.</p>

<p>In the old days, when there was no craft on the river bigger
than the native canoe, journeys were long and tedious. From
Koulikoro to Timbuctu, even with relays<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_136">[136]</span> of canoemen at frequent intervals, it was
impossible to cover the distance in less than three weeks, but now
a very different state of affairs exists, and the journey can be
done on the average in twelve days. Since the railway has reached
Koulikoro repairing-shops and a dock have been made, and the fleet
of steaming-vessels has been greatly augmented at this port of the
Niger.</p>

<p>One of my companions at dinner was a platelayer in charge of a
section of the line between Koulikoro and Bamako. As I happened to
mention to him that I should much like to see the rapids on the
Niger below Bamako, of which I had often heard, he very kindly
offered to take me next morning by trolly to a station within easy
walk of some of the rapids. I was delighted at the offer, which I
gladly accepted.</p>

<p>Next morning, as the sun was rising, I met my friend at the
station, where he had his trolly ready. Our destination was a
little place called Kiénéfala, about twenty miles down the line. It
was very pleasant in the early morning air as we glided swiftly
along, running by our own momentum easily down the declines, while
our trolly boys, four stalwart Bambaras, pushed us up the inclines.
There is something very exhilarating in the motion of a trolly. The
sensation is that of being in a train, but with this advantage,
that you have the benefit of being in the open air instead of being
shut into a hot compartment. As we rattled merrily along we caught
glimpses of bushfowl and guinea-fowl, who, scared by our approach,
scuttled into the bush as we bore down upon them. Occasionally a
duiker, or bushbuck, would be seen in the distance, terrified at
the appearance of this strange, swift-moving object which invaded
the privacy of their sylvan haunts. Whole families of monkeys were
frequently to be seen gambolling on the track, along which they
hurried as we made our appearance, only finally to dive into the
bush as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span> they
realized the pursuing demon was overtaking them. Unfortunately I
was never able to get close enough to these animals for a
successful photograph.</p>

<p>In a little over two hours we arrived at the station, where we
dismounted from the trolly. Half an hour’s walk brought us to the
Niger and we were close to the rapids. There are two sets of rapids
which interrupt the navigation between Bamako and Koulikoro. About
eight miles below the former town are the rapids of Sotuba, and,
below them again, the rapids of Kiénéfala, which we were now
visiting. For many miles this section of the river is very rocky
and, even for canoes, navigation is difficult. The water was low
here and we were able to clamber over rocky boulders into the
middle of the stream, from whence we got a capital view of the
rapids. As we gazed up-stream we could see that the river was split
into three channels, separated from each other by huge fragments of
rock. Immediately in front of us was the centre channel. On each
side of this channel was a rocky wall towering up to a height of
thirty feet above our heads. Some two hundred yards away the water
came swirling along in a seething torrent, until it suddenly
reached the rugged precipice down which it fell in headlong
impetuosity. It looked as if no craft could live in that pitiless,
rushing stream, yet one or two Frenchmen have successfully
descended those rapids.</p>

<p>At the bottom the water flows swiftly through a channel, said to
be very deep, and then on for a couple of miles till the rocks
begin to disappear and the three separated portions of the river
reunite. The water below the rapids is of the most beautiful deep
blue colour—a blue I have never seen in any other river, but
strongly resembling the blue one sees in the Mediterranean. I could
have stayed for hours watching this splendid sight; the grandeur of
the rapids, the roar of the waters and the beauty of the
blue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span> stream at our
feet carried me away from the commonplace doings of the world. It
was one of those moments, which come to us all at times, when one
feels mentally and physically in touch with nature.</p>

<p>My companion suddenly awoke me from my reverie, pointing to the
sun, which was now high up in the sky. We had to get back quickly
as the down train was due in less than two hours. After a little
refreshment at the platelayer’s house near the station we mounted
our trolly once more and proceeded on the homeward trip. At a
little village called Madambougou, we halted to examine the graves
of some Frenchmen who had been buried there. These men were members
of the expedition which descended the Niger in 1884 under
Lieutenant Hourst, the well-known explorer. Hourst was a naval
officer who organized a small fleet of canoes for this expedition,
and starting from Bamako with a few European companions and a
following of native canoemen successfully descended the Rapids of
Sotuba and Kiénéfala. After descending the Kiénéfala Rapids he made
a camp near Madambougou, and, while there repairing damages to his
canoes, he lost two or three white men from sickness, while others
were unfortunately killed in a canoe accident. For many years the
whereabouts of these graves could not be discovered, until at last,
when the bush was being cut down in connection with some work on
the railway line, the tombstones of the victims of the Hourst
Expedition were disclosed. The little graveyard has now been
cleared and is kept in good order.</p>

<p>A few weeks later I met a French naval officer, the
Superintendent of the Niger Surveys, who had just arrived from
France, and had come by river all the way from Bamako, descending
the rapids <i>en route</i>. He, like Hourst, came down in an
ordinary “dug-out” canoe, and, although successful, he informed me
it was a thrilling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
experience and one he would not lightly undertake again. The
smallest mistake or hesitation on the part of the steersman must
result in the frail craft being inevitably dashed against the
rocks, and there would be no hope for the occupants.</p>

<p>In the early days of French exploration an explorer called Maje
had penetrated into the Soudan as far as Koulikoro. Just outside
that village he was attacked by the inhabitants and killed on the
hill which is to be seen at the south end of the place. Maje’s
death was not avenged for some time, but his name has since been
perpetuated in one of the stern-wheeler boats in use on the Niger;
she was lying in the river when I was at Koulikoro, but useless
till the next rainy season owing to the scarcity of water at that
time.</p>

<p>That afternoon I walked out to Koulikoro Bara, two miles off, to
call on the officers of the local garrison. A broad road leads to
the village, and the officers’ quarters are perched on the top of a
hill above it. The road had a soft, sandy surface and seemed to be
a favourite resort for riders in the evening. When I passed some
half-dozen natives were racing on their gaily ornamented steeds.
Excitement among the spectators was running at a high pitch as the
cavaliers came tearing furiously down the road, urging their mounts
forward with wild cries and much spurring. The winner at the end of
the course, shouting triumphantly at his victory, drew rein so
suddenly as to throw his horse on to its haunches, to the imminent
danger of those following, who narrowly escaped a collision.</p>

<p>I was shown round the barracks by a young artillery officer, who
was temporarily in charge of the station, and he very kindly
offered to lend me a horse for the remainder of my stay at
Koulikoro. But I was unable to make much use of his offer, for when
I returned to the hotel I found a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_140">[140]</span> message to say that the steam-launch would
leave the following day.</p>

<p>The next morning I rose early as I had arranged to pay a visit
to the horse-breeding establishment which was about three miles
away. I was met by Captain de Franco, who took great pains to show
me the well-managed stables under his care. Very few mares are
kept, but the stallions of the establishment are sent out to
districts where a good class of mare is known to exist, and the
owners of the mares are bound to sell the progeny to Government
should they be required so to do. The reason for this is that it
was found many of the Government mares were infected with the
trypnazome produced by the tsetse-fly-bite. Some of them died,
while others dropped dead foals, and so it was considered to be a
wiser plan to let the risk of these accidents be borne by the
native rather than by Government. Captain de Franco informed me
that they had treated several cases of this disease successfully
with arsenic, but although the victim’s life was saved the horse
was never as strong as he had originally been.</p>

<p>The animals were certainly some of the finest I had seen in the
Western Soudan. Most of them came from the districts of Nioro and
Sokolo, on the left bank of the Niger. They averaged a little over
15 hands, some showing distinct signs of Arab blood. We walked over
to the riding-school, where the young horses were being exercised.
The riders were native lads, most of whom were expert horsemen
before they came to the establishment, I was told. The difficulty
is not to teach them to ride, but to teach them to be good
horsemasters. They have been used to the brutal native methods,
using the cruel native bit, and regarding the horse as a machine
incapable of feeling pain or fatigue. Once these ideas have been
driven out of their heads they become very useful members of the
stables.</p>

<p>The captain was very proud of his house, which he
had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span> built himself
with materials specially ordered from France. It was certainly very
comfortable and furnished with great taste.</p>

<p>I hurried back to the hotel to find my servant sending the loads
down to the wharf. In the last two days I had rearranged my kit,
and repacked the “chop-boxes,” and had reduced my possessions to
twelve carriers’ loads. I now went to the Navigation Offices, where
I purchased my ticket for Niafounké. I was introduced to the
<i>brigadier de vaisseaux</i>, the European skipper of the little
launch, with whom I had to share a cabin. Accommodation on the boat
was limited. There was a tiny cabin with two berths “forard,” while
other passengers had to pitch their camp beds, if they could find
room, in the stern of the vessel. Some of the baggage was stowed in
the hold, but the heavier articles were in the lighter which we
were to tow. My fellow-passengers were two European
non-commissioned officers. One of them was proceeding to the
garrison town of Bobo-Djilassu, while the other was bound for
Timbuctu. I must say I pitied these two men; they were so cramped
in the narrow space allowed them that the discomfort of a journey
down-river lasting several days must have been great. To add to the
general unpleasantness there was only a thin awning to protect
their heads from the fierce sun, so that they could never discard
their sun-helmets during the day.</p>

<p>In the bows of the steam-launch there was a small space
available, with just room for a couple of chairs, and in the centre
of this space was the wheel, where the steersman took up his
position. Our crew were mostly Bambaras, three of whom were river
pilots. A special knowledge of the river is necessary for the man
at the wheel, as the Niger is full of sandbanks, rocks and other
dangers to navigators. Our vessel was the “Réné Caillé,” called
after the famous French explorer of that name, who in the
years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span> 1827 and 1828
came across the Sahara from Morocco to Timbuctu, eventually
returning to Europe by the same route. These boats are known to the
French as <i>vedettes</i>, while the stern-wheelers are called
<i>monoroues</i>; the latter appears to be a misnomer, for these
boats have two wheels, and not a single one.</p>

<p>In the lighter towed behind us, besides the baggage, there was a
collection of natives. Some of these were soldiers with their wives
and families, and a very happy party they seemed to be as they sat
on packing-cases at the bottom of the boat, chattering and laughing
while we waited for the <i>brigadier</i> to come aboard. All
formalities were at length completed, and the Director of
Navigation came out of his office with our skipper to bid me
good-bye.</p>

<p>As we steamed away from the shores of Koulikoro I felt my
spirits rise at the prospect of seeing “fresh woods and pastures
new,” and this bade fair to be one of the most interesting portions
of my journey, for at last I was on the navigable Niger, after
following it from its source for so many hundred miles and seeing
it gradually grow from a tiny, insignificant stream into a fine,
big waterway.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AS we glided easily down the river I began to
think that life on the “Réné Caillé” would be rather pleasant.</p>

<p>It was very enjoyable to sit on deck in an easy chair watching
the rapidly changing landscape as we went along merrily at five or
six miles an hour.</p>

<p>The river was not more than 400 yards wide here, and its bed was
frequently split into three or four channels by spits of sandbank.
Many of these channels were certainly not more than forty yards
wide, so the little launch required careful handling to get her
round the numerous turnings of the stream. On the left bank the
Koulikoro Hills were still to be seen gradually extending farther
and farther from the shore until they were lost in a blue haze in
the distance.</p>

<p>On the right bank the country was extremely flat, vegetation had
become more and more scarce, until, on this side, the ground was
merely covered with patches of low scrub.</p>

<p>Occasionally we passed a fishing village, a collection of small
mud huts huddled together on the river banks. As we steamed by a
swarm of black urchins would come out to look at the launch, waving
their dusky little arms and shouting greetings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
</p>

<p>As evening began to fall a number of tiny islets, fringed with
trees, began to appear on the landscape. In spite of the dry
weather the trees were clothed in mantles of rich green, relieved
only by masses of ruddy, orange-coloured flowers, in places where
the beautiful “Flamboyant” or “Gold mohur” tree prospered. Canoes
laden with grain and paddled by a couple of sturdy natives
frequently passed us, while occasionally a barge under full sail
with cargo from the big markets down-stream passed us, speeding on
her way to Koulikoro.</p>

<p>The next morning we reached the important trading village of
Nyamina. This place was considerably larger than anything we had
yet seen. The houses are built of the reddish-brown Niger mud; they
are solidly constructed dwellings, the colour of which so nearly
approximates to that of the surrounding soil that the inexperienced
eye cannot detect the presence of a village until almost within
hailing distance of it. Nyamina is on an important trade-route
leading from Southern Mauretania to the Niger, and it is at this
point that caravans cross the river on their way to the big markets
of Bobo-Djilassu and Sikasso. Even as we arrived a big convoy of at
least 300 camels, which had just come in, was to be seen watering
at the river brink. The camels would not cross the Niger here, but
the merchandise would be transported to its destination on
carriers’ heads. It was the first time on this journey that I had
come across camels, and it was a curious thing that at my first
view of them I should see no less than 300. We halted here for an
hour to take in wood. A certain amount of coal, in the form of
briquettes imported from France, is burnt on the Niger vessels, but
the majority of their fuel consists of wood. Special arrangements
are made with the headmen of certain villages on the banks to stack
wood for the use of steamers. When a boat requires fuel she blows
her steam-whistle to attract<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_145">[145]</span> the attention of the village, and then
gives an order for the amount taken to the headman. The latter can
obtain payment for his wood on presenting the order to the
Commissioner of his district.</p>

<p>On resuming our way we approached a part of the river where
sandbanks appeared to be more numerous than ever. After two or
three ominous bumps we suddenly felt a severe shock and the little
vessel came to a dead stop. We had stuck fast on a sandbank. Our
skipper shouted the order to go full-speed astern, but all his
efforts seemed unavailing. The crew were then made to jump into the
water, and after shoving and straining for about half an hour with
the engines going astern the whole time we at last got clear.</p>

<p>Soon after this misadventure I noticed ahead of us a big
lighter, flying the French flag in the stern. We rapidly overtook
her, and as we came abreast of each other the two crews exchanged
greetings, shouting to one another the usual string of salutations
which are customary in this country. When one begins to understand
the language it is amusing to listen to the varied nature of the
questions the native asks a fellow-traveller when they meet. The
usual type of question and answer is much like this: “Welcome, my
friend, I hope you are well.” “Quite well, praise be to Allah, and
how are you, my friend?” “I am very well, but is your house in good
repair?” “Yes, thank you, but tell me news of your horse.” These
salutations continue for ten minutes or more, and each traveller
wastes a considerable amount of time on every journey in this
fashion. Even when the two men have resumed their way they can be
heard shouting back salutations to each other as long as their
voices are audible. Besides the ordinary greetings, corresponding
to our “Good morning,” “Good night,” etc., these simple natives
have such greetings as “I salute you in the rain,” or “Greetings
for the sunshine,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
and a host of other expressions according as it is rainy or fine
weather, etc.</p>

<p>On the deck of the barge were two Europeans, a man and a woman.
They turned out to be the Resident of Koulikoro and his wife, whom
I had met a few days previously. The former had been appointed a
Commissioner in the district of Bandiagara, whither he now was on
his way. I expected to meet them again later, as I was likely to be
shooting in their district. However, we missed, and I never saw
them again. The “Réné Caillé” soon outdistanced the barge, but she
overtook us again during the course of the day, owing to our launch
sticking, on several occasions of more or less long duration, on
sandbanks.</p>

<p>This portion of the river is inhabited by a number of
crocodiles. These repulsive creatures are hated and feared quite as
much by the black man as by the European. Consequently there were
several members of the crew eagerly on the look-out for the
crouching forms of these animals as they basked in the sun on a
sandbank. Immediately one was seen I used to be informed and would
pick up my rifle for a shot. Sometimes even the keen eyes of the
“boys” would be deceived, and they would mistake a log for a
crocodile; there really is not much difference in the appearance of
the two objects, and often one’s first intimation of the presence
of a crocodile is given by seeing the supposed log suddenly and
swiftly slide off the bank into the water. In the dazzling sun it
was frequently difficult to distinguish these beasts, for their
yellowish-grey bodies would assimilate well with the sand on which
they were lying. Sometimes we would see them swimming in the river,
the only thing discernible being a black speck just raised above
the level of the water, which was probably a bit of the head. The
natives are afraid to bathe in this portion of the river, owing to
the frequent accidents which have occurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
</p>

<p>Many were the gruesome stories we were told. One of the pilots
said he had a brother who was a fisherman in these parts. This man
had a small son, and one day the mother had taken him down to the
river while she was drawing water. The little fellow toddled a few
yards off and began splashing in the shallow water near the edge of
the stream, when by some misfortune he slipped into a deep pool and
was at once carried off by a crocodile. The mother’s first warning
was a cry of terror from the child, as it was drawn struggling
under water by the horrible creature. The unfortunate woman’s
horror and anguish as she stood there powerless must have been
terrible to witness. Crocodiles are objects of superstition among
the natives here. Usually crocodiles in the abstract are regarded
as a “juju,” but in some cases these animals are kept alive in the
village for fetish purposes.</p>

<p>At one place where we halted in the evening there was a big tank
in the centre of the village. In this tank there lived a huge
crocodile, for which the natives had a wholesome respect not
unmingled with fear. Around the tank they had built a strong mud
wall, several feet high. The creature used to be fed daily with
enormous lumps of meat. He was reputed to be fifty years old, and
he probably was a good deal older than that even, for the most aged
inhabitants of the place could remember his existence when they
were children. Undoubtedly crocodiles live to a very great age.</p>

<p>River crocodiles are said to travel long distances at times. I
recollect once in India a river crocodile was found in a small
swamp about twelve miles from the nearest water. It was known that
no crocodile had been in the swamp previously, and it seemed as if
it must have come across dry land for the whole of that
distance.</p>

<p>The “Réné Caillé” used to steam about twelve hours a day, from
sunrise to sunset. I suppose we covered an average daily distance
of sixty miles. Travelling, even by<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_148">[148]</span> the moon, at night was impossible owing to
the narrowness of the navigable channel. When there is plenty of
water in the river boats travel day and night. About five o’clock,
or a little later, we generally halted for the night near a
village. A supply of wood was then taken on board so as to be ready
for an early start next day, and after that duty had been performed
all hands were allowed to fall out to cook their evening meal. It
was a cheery sight to watch the camp fires dotted about on the
river bank, each with a little group of black figures busily
engaged in cooking operations, while the little launch lay
peacefully at anchor with the last rays of the setting sun
reflecting their red light on to her.</p>

<p>I was glad to step ashore and stretch my legs on these
occasions. If it was not too late I used to take my gun and a
“boy,” and stroll off on the chance of getting a shot at a bushfowl
or pigeon. On this part of the river there was a big, mottled
pigeon. Its colour resembled red-roan more nearly than anything
else. This pigeon is about twice as large as a green pigeon, and I
always saw it near water. It feeds chiefly on rice or millet.
Waterfowl were still extremely scarce; since leaving Koulikoro I
had only seen one flight of duck.</p>

<p>The non-commissioned officer, who was going to Bobo Djilassu,
was a keen sportsman and used often to accompany me in the evening
expeditions. His gun was a 16-bore, and he told me he never
bothered to clean it. One day out of curiosity I looked down the
barrels. It certainly was in a very dirty condition, and it passes
my comprehension how he managed to shoot with it at all. He was not
a bad shot at a bird on the wing, but used to say he could not
understand the necessity for shooting at birds flying when you
could so often get an easy shot at a sitting pigeon or bushfowl!
However, we had some pleasant walks together and generally brought
in something for the “pot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
</p>

<p>Sand-flies on the river banks were frequently very bad at night.
I found that my small-meshed mosquito-curtain was invaluable. But
the worst time for these plaguy little creatures was between
sundown and bedtime. They seemed to be aware how helpless we were,
and took the opportunity of making the most of those two or three
hours. Big logs of wood were scarce, and somehow a lot of small
fires did not seem to give the same immunity from their attacks as
did one big log fire. I preferred to sleep on shore, but my
companions usually slept on board. The chief drawback to sleeping
on shore was that one had to rise in the dark in order to get the
kit stowed aboard before we started. The nights were very cool and
pleasant, and being safe under my net from the onslaughts of the
insects, I always managed to sleep very comfortably.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of March we reached Ségou. This town is 112 miles
down the Niger from Koulikoro, on the right bank of the river. As
we approached the hitherto brown, sandy banks became fringed with
fresh green vegetation; this was tobacco, which is grown to a great
extent here. The leaf is small, and therefore, although the tobacco
is of good quality, it is not worth exporting to France. The
natives smoke it and use it as snuff. Tobacco is a greatly
appreciated luxury in this country. It is only grown in strictly
limited localities, and invariably commands a high price in the
market. The tobacco plantations gradually disappeared as we drew
nearer to the town, and wide-spreading trees made their appearance
together with the Europeans’ gardens of vegetables and flowers.
Ségou is the capital of the district of that name; it is an
important trading place with a fairly large population of white
men.</p>

<p>We were to stay here three hours, so I went ashore to call on
the Commissioner. He lived in a well-built mud house, a portion of
which was his office. While talking to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_150">[150]</span> him a young Frenchman entered to whom I was
introduced. He was the agent of the French Cotton-Growing
Association. This gentleman very kindly offered to show me his
ginning apparatus, a proposal which I eagerly accepted. M. Level,
who spoke English remarkably well, was a most interesting man to
meet. He had had a large experience of cotton-growing in different
parts of the world, and was therefore peculiarly qualified to speak
on this subject. A good deal of cotton is grown in the basin of the
Niger about here, Ségou being the central market to which the stuff
is generally brought.</p>

<p>Native-grown cotton, as was previously explained, is short in
the staple and rather coarse. The French Cotton-Growing Association
has tried to introduce the cultivation of Egyptian and American
cotton. M. Level had distributed large quantities of these seeds to
the natives in the endeavour to induce them to grow a better class
of cotton, but, he informed me, the result so far had not been very
encouraging. The output had been small compared with the quantity
of seed distributed, and this, it appeared, was not so much due to
the soil being unsuitable, as to the natives being too lazy to
plant the cotton. Ginning is carried on upon a big scale; there is
also a hydraulic press for compressing the cotton as it is packed
into bales. The Association has its own barges which transport the
cotton to Koulikoro for shipment to Europe. There are also two
other branches; one in the south of the colony on the Bani River,
and the other at Kayes, on the Senegal River.</p>

<p>M. Level introduced me to the officers of the garrison, who took
me to their quarters and were most eager to be told all about the
life of a British officer in West Africa, and to know whether I
thought it differed much from their mode of living. In many cases
the French do not have regular messes, but each officer lives by
himself, and once or twice in the week each individual takes a turn
in inviting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span> his
brother officers to dinner or <i>déjeuner</i>. They seem to prefer
this method, saying it obviates the disadvantage of the too-close
companionship of mess life.</p>

<p>On leaving Ségou we had a recurrence of the troubles of the
previous day. In fact, this portion of the Niger is the most
difficult to navigate of any part between Koulikoro and Timbuctu.
The channel is continually blocked by shoals, making progress very
slow and travelling very irksome. There are a lot of fishing
villages about here, and large herds of cattle are seen at times.
The fisherfolk are Bosos, a hardy race, but people of no great
intelligence. The Bosos are pagans; they are looked down on by the
superior tribes who surround them, and appear to have little
ambition. These people have ever been a downtrodden race, so that
probably any spirit they once had was long ago crushed by their
numerous conquerors during the troubled times before the French
appeared at the end of last century.</p>

<p>The next day we arrived at Sansanding, where we had to halt a
whole day to effect some repairs to the machinery. This place is a
semi-independent native State, governed by a native ruler, called
the “Fama.” It is interesting as being the only native State with
its own little Government in the colony, or I believe in the whole
of French West Africa. The Fama is a most enlightened man, who was
educated at the Government College at Kayes, and afterwards went to
France. He speaks French well and has very sound ideas for a native
about the administration of his Government. He has built himself a
European house, in which he possesses French furniture, pictures,
china and a host of modern comforts. He was very hospitable,
insisting on our partaking of wine and coffee with him. The town is
neatly built and kept in good order.</p>

<p>Owing to the shallow water we had to anchor two miles
down-stream, and went up the small creek leading to the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span> town in a canoe. Between the
town and the launch there was a stretch of grassy bush, so, before
returning to the boat, I decided to investigate the shooting
possibilities of this bit of country, intending to walk back by the
river bank. I was alone on this occasion, as the French
non-commissioned officer who used to accompany me had disembarked
at Ségou, whence he would march to his destination in the south of
the colony. The Fama’s shooting-ground proved to be an excellent
one. The good people of Sansanding had evidently not much
acquaintance with guns, and were quite scared when they saw me
raise a harmless-looking object to my shoulder and simultaneously
heard a report. When a bird fell the astonishment of the natives
was great. I believe they thought it the work of some wonderful and
mysterious “medicine.” Most of my beaters dispersed with marvellous
rapidity at the noise of the discharge. Weapons of any description
are scarce here, but the chief national arm is the spear, although
even that is but rarely seen.</p>

<p>On returning to the launch I found a small fish market was in
progress on the sandy river bank. The wives of the soldiers, who
were being towed in the steel canoe behind us, were bargaining with
great zest and vehemence. It appeared that the buyers and sellers
had very divergent views on the subject of what was a fair price to
charge. If I had not fortunately arrived on the scene I am afraid
the ladies of the two parties would so far have forgotten their
good manners as to come to blows.</p>

<p>On leaving Sansanding the boat was hailed by a canoe which just
came round a bend in the river as we started. We hove to and
awaited the arrival of the occupant. It was one of the sons of the
Fama, who had come with a present of milk and eggs from his father.
This youth, whom we had not seen on paying our visit to the town
that morning, also spoke French and had been to the High
School<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span> at Dakar for
his education. I am afraid, however, that he will never be so fine
a specimen of a native as the present Fama, and it seems doubtful
if he will have the chance of succeeding his father. I understand
that when the present ruler dies the French intend to incorporate
Sansanding as a new district in the colony of Upper Senegal and
Niger.</p>

<p class="justify">This little steamer was my home for some 450
miles of the journey down the Niger. We had halted here to take in
fuel, and my camera has had the effect of interrupting some heated
bargaining between the fish-sellers on the beach and some native
passengers.</p>

<p class="sc">Steel Canoes on the Upper Niger</p>

<p class="justify">Steel canoes are a convenient and much-used
means of conveyance on the Niger. They are strong, light, of very
shallow draught, and at the same time can carry a big cargo of
passengers or merchandise. Shelter from the sun is improvised by
fixing palm-thatch awnings overhead. These craft can be poled or
paddled, according to the depth of water available.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The appearance of the river alters considerably from this point.
The banks become more wooded, and backwaters and small tributaries
penetrate far into the country on both sides. Some of these
waterways are navigable for launches, but the channel is narrow and
constantly broken into two or more parts by small islands. At
Diafarabé the right bank is intersected in a hundred places by
these creeks, and in the rainy season the town, which is low-lying,
must be almost under water. From this place the interesting town of
Djenné can be reached by water. Djenné is the “holy city” of the
French Soudan.</p>

<p>The biggest mosques are here, and the priests have the
reputation of being the most devout. The standard of learning is
also higher here than elsewhere; so much is this the case that the
French have allowed an Arabic school to be established at Djenné in
preference to any of the commercially more important towns of the
Soudan. Almost every village has a “Kadi,” who practically
corresponds to the “Munshi” of India. He it is who writes all the
letters of the villagers, for most of the latter cannot read or
write, of course. When a reply comes it is his business to read it
to the recipient. These “Kadis” make a profitable income out of
this work, and it is at Djenné that they are taught. The letters
are written in Arabic characters. All letters are written in Arabic
in this country, there being no written native language; it follows
that, even if a letter is read out to the addressee by the “Kadi,”
the former cannot understand the purport until it has been
translated into his own tongue. It will<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_154">[154]</span> be understood that under these
circumstances letter-writing and reading are slow and tedious
matters.</p>

<p>The majority of the inhabitants of Djenné are Sonrhais, a nation
of whom there will be more to say later. In olden times, probably
up to the fifteenth century, they used to display a certain amount
of originality in their architecture. The houses of the town are
built with minarets and cupolas, while over the doorways and in the
windows there is a fair amount of fresco work. This is the only
race which apparently had some idea of architecture, for this art
is noticeably conspicuous by its absence as a rule among negroid
tribes of Western Africa.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that this interesting place has always been a
town of importance. It is situated in the richest grain-producing
country of the Niger south of Timbuctu, and thus has invariably
attracted a large number of traders.</p>

<p>The Niger now becomes deeper and wider, and soon after Diafarabé
it assumes a more northerly direction. We passed several river
barges about this time; some are owned by the Government and some
are the property of private individuals or French trading firms.
For sails they use big, mat-like contrivances made out of grass.
These primitive sails look very picturesque. They have the
advantage of being cheap and easily repaired, but, of course, they
are not very durable. The grass out of which they are made grows on
the banks, and is a kind of supple reed. They are plaited around
sticks, which are pegged into the ground so as to enclose a hollow
square of the area of the required sail. When the wind is not
favourable these barges are poled.</p>

<p>The pilots now had an easier time, for the water being deeper
navigation was no longer such anxious work. Two of these men used
to be on duty at a time. One managed the wheel, while the other
stood in the bows of our little<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_155">[155]</span> craft, pole in hand, ready to take
soundings by measuring the depth of water shown by his stick at any
place where it shallowed suddenly. These pilots wore rather a
picturesque garb, blue and white vests, blue serge, baggy trousers,
and a red tam-o’-shanter, the kit somewhat reminding one of the
French sailor, from whom it was probably copied. Those not on duty
used to spend their time fishing. The fishing tackle consisted
merely of a stout line with a hook on the end to which was attached
a piece of fish as bait. This line was dropped over the stern and
towed behind us as we moved. I cannot say they were very successful
with their fishing tackle, for I only saw them make two catches
during the whole voyage. Another amusement was to make fish-nets,
for which purpose their toes came into great request. The native
makes great use of his toes for catching hold of a loose end of
rope; indeed, he is often more nimble with his toes than with his
fingers.</p>

<p>I used generally to pass the morning writing up my diary, and
working out the previous day’s observations; after lunch I would
join my fellow-passengers on deck, where it was pleasant to sit and
read or watch the changing scenery, with an occasional shot at a
crocodile by way of variation. About this time we were delayed by a
strike in the engine-room among the stokers. Two of these men were
so insubordinate as to necessitate their being put in irons; this
left us very short-handed. We stopped at the nearest village to try
to get two substitutes, but the new hands were so stupid as to be
almost useless. To make matters worse some of the machinery got
seriously out of order, and we had to slow down in consequence. The
whole of the engine-room seemed to be disaffected, and I could not
help thinking that the breakdown in the machinery was purposely
done by them out of spite. Unfortunately the skipper was newly
arrived from France, and had not much experience of the wiles of
the natives;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span> but we
were now near Mopti, where villages were less scarce, and the river
was widening considerably.</p>

<p>On the marshy, low-lying banks grazed big herds of cattle,
followed by an indolent rustic, who turned round to stare in idle
curiosity as we approached. Sometimes the launch would let off her
steam-whistle, and at the sound of this unaccustomed noise the
cattle would career wildly away in terror. Flocks of sheep and
goats there were too, but the river banks were often too swampy to
permit of the latter grazing near the water’s edge. All this
country is extraordinarily flat; for miles in every direction there
is an uninterrupted view of a flat, grassy plain through which the
Niger slowly wends its way. The fall of this river is very gradual,
as can be easily appreciated from the fact that it takes 2440 miles
to fall less than 4000 feet in its course from the Tembikunda
Mountains to the sea. Hence the current is extremely slow as a
rule. The river is here still known by the name of Joliba to the
natives, and it is not till it enters the British territory of
Northern Nigeria that the natives call it Kwarra, or Kworra, a name
it preserves until it reaches the sea.</p>

<p>As the river widened we noticed several large creeks on both
sides, until we came to a very large stream flowing into the Niger
from the east. This river, which was even wider here than the
Niger, was the Bani, and as soon as we entered it we saw in the
distance the town of Mopti.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="chap_sum">A land of inundations — River transport in the
Macina Province — The “King of Mopti” — Mopti — Prospects of the
rice trade — Shooting wart-hog — Native huts — The protection of
egrets — A lion as a pet — A dangerous joke — Scarcity of wood —
The white ant — The driver ant.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MOPTI is the chief town in the rich province of
Macina. The province lies entirely on the right bank of the Niger.
It extends on the north to Lake Dhebo, on the east almost to
Bandiagara, and on the south to the town of Djenné. The whole
country is flat, except for a low range of hills to the northward.
The towns are all built on slightly rising ground, in order to
avoid the floods which cover the country-side at certain times of
the year. Indeed, were it not for this slight elevation upon which
they stand, they would inevitably be submerged; as it is, they
stand out like islands from the midst of the surrounding plains.
Practically the whole province is inundated during the season of
floods by reason of its low-lying situation.</p>

<p>Two big rivers are the main factors in producing this state of
affairs; one is the Niger, while the other is its affluent the
Bani. Besides these two big streams there are numerous tributaries
of both which play their part in the inundations. Macina is the
richest grain-producing country of the French Soudan. Huge areas of
land are under cultivation for rice and millet, large quantities
being exported annually to feed the people of the Senegal
Colony.</p>

<p>The soil is peculiarly adapted to these two cereals.
Rice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span> is grown on
the clayey ground found close to the river banks, while the drier,
sandier soil found farther away from the rivers is admirably suited
to the production of millet.</p>

<p>The country may be, and frequently is, compared with Egypt.
There is a striking similarity between the physical geography of
the two lands. In each case a mighty river flowing through a flat,
sandy country, fertilizes huge tracts of land on its banks by its
annual inundations. But here the resemblance ends.</p>

<p>In Egypt nature’s handiwork is aided and improved by artificial
irrigation—digging canals, making dams, etc.</p>

<p>In the Western Soudan nature does everything and man does
nothing. The native is too lazy to dig irrigation canals, for he
makes large profits out of his grain crops as they are, and has not
the necessary ambition to wish to increase them. “I have enough to
eat and clothe myself,” says he, “and there is sufficient to
satisfy the needs of my wife and children; therefore, why should I
toil further?” His mode of argument is a natural one and is very
common in the fertile countries of West Africa. It is an
acknowledged fact that not a quarter of the fertile land is under
cultivation, and by judicious irrigation the fertile area could be
more than doubled. The population is undoubtedly small compared
with the area of the country, but the existing numbers could
certainly grow far larger crops than they do at present, without
greatly increasing their working days.</p>

<p>The population is augmenting rapidly, as a natural result of the
existing prosperity and peace under the French rule; for this land
suffered like so many others from the constant petty wars which
were waged up to the end of last century.</p>

<p>In the season of the floods it must be a wonderful sight to gaze
from Mopti over the huge lake which spreads its<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span> waters over the face of the
land for 100 miles in one direction and sixty miles without
interruption in another direction. I regretted that I was
travelling in the middle of the dry season, and when I was at Mopti
the rivers were confined within their natural limits. I was told
that when the country was inundated the game all herded together in
the few dry spots available, so that shooting them was positively
slaughter. The unfortunate animals are frequently surprised by the
sudden and rapid rise of the water, being either drowned or cut off
without chance of retreat until the water subsides.</p>

<p>Owing to the existence of these waterways transport by river in
the Macina Province is obviously greatly facilitated. The Bani
River is navigable to Djenné, 100 kilometres distant, and even at
times to the town of Sikasso. Djenné is not actually on the Bani,
but a navigable creek connects the town with the stream. Lighters
and launches can use that river as long as they can navigate the
Niger; canoes can use it during all the months of the year without
difficulty. The future of this province seems to be assured, for
the increasing population will give a great impetus to rice and
millet growing; in the course of time irrigation is certain to be
introduced, and the revenue will go up by leaps and bounds.</p>

<p>Almost immediately opposite the junction of the rivers Niger and
Bani there is a small town, with an imposing-looking building of
wood and galvanized iron. The place is Charlotte Ville, while the
house, I was informed by a pilot, belonged to the “King of Mopti.”
Charlotte Ville is really a part of Mopti, and as one proceeds up
the Bani the two other portions of which the place is composed come
into view. These two latter, being quite two miles from the former,
are close together, standing on the top of miniature elevations
rising out of the surrounding plain.</p>

<p>The centre portion is the abode of the Resident and<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span> traders; all the natives are
being gradually relegated to the southern part; while Charlotte
Ville is noteworthy for being the residence of a French colonist.
It was this colonist who was mentioned to me as being the “King of
Mopti,” and I was much surprised to hear that his majesty was a
white man. I believe his title originated from a large fortune
which he had made, and lost, in the place. In any case he had lived
many years at Mopti, had had large dealings with the natives, and
was well known to them for many miles around. This gentleman
supplied the Europeans with vegetables and fruit from a fine large
farm which he had made on the place.</p>

<p>At Mopti proper, where the Resident resides, the place has quite
a civilized appearance. On approaching it we could see several
European buildings with tin roofs, conspicuous amongst the brown,
mud-built native houses. The town is built well up on a slight
eminence for the reasons previously stated, a wide stretch of sandy
foreshore extending down to the water edge. A few leafy trees throw
a grateful shade on the front of the town, otherwise trees are
singularly deficient around Mopti. The surrounding plain, when I
passed through, was covered with scrubby grass, very much burnt up
at this time of the year. The market-place has a distinctly Moorish
appearance. This portion of the town is behind the European
quarters, and consists of small, narrow streets in which are long
rows of mud-built booths, open at the back and front, where are to
be seen the vendors of local produce, squatted native-fashion
behind their wares.</p>

<p>The Resident was away when I arrived, but I was shown the places
of interest by the Assistant Resident, who, by his wide knowledge
of the natives and the country, had evidently an extended
experience of them.</p>

<p>A road is being built from the main town to a low range of hills
in the north, in order to connect the place with dry<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span> land during the floods. The
road is an embankment some thirty feet above the plain and its
length is to be about eight miles, so the task is not an easy one.
Another road is to be constructed to unite Mopti proper with the
native town. A fair road exists between Charlotte Ville and the
Residency, so that very shortly the three portions of Mopti will be
permanently connected.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw3" id="i16"><img src="images/i16.jpg" alt=
"">
<div>
<p class="sc">Mopti. Street Scene</p>

<p class="justify">The appearance is decidedly Eastern. Natives
squat in their mud-built stalls haggling, as is the manner of their
kind, over some trifling bargain. Trade routes from the Ivory
Coast, Gold Coast, Dahomey, and the distant eastern “Bend” of the
Niger all send their quota of produce to this market.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>A big school is also being built, to which the surplus pupils of
the Djenné Arabic College will be sent. Altogether Mopti is a very
go-ahead little town, and certainly one of the most prosperous on
this section of the Niger.</p>

<p>At Mopti I was introduced to an interesting French merchant, M.
Simon. This gentleman has done much to try to improve the quality
of rice put on the market by the Macina Province. I mentioned that
a quantity of this rice was exported to Senegal, but it did not
find great favour there, because it was dirtier in appearance than
the Indo-China rice, also the latter could be bought almost as
cheaply at St. Louis as Macina rice. The high rate of transport on
the Senegal-Niger Railway was largely responsible for this big
price. M. Simon was of opinion that if the rice were cleaned
locally it would be more appreciated at St. Louis, and, further,
that by setting up a mill at Mopti, the cost of unhusking it could
be materially reduced, permitting it to be sold at a lower price
and thereby successfully competing with the Indo-China article. The
rice is not really dirty, but grain grown in this country has a
small reddish streak in it which gives it an unappetizing
appearance in comparison to the milky white rice from
Indo-China.</p>

<p>M. Simon has imported a mill which can perform three distinct
operations:</p>

<p>(1) Clean the rice.</p>

<p>(2) Unhusk it.</p>

<p>(3) Scrape off the red skin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
</p>

<p>This mill can treat 2000 tons per annum. M. Simon proposes to
import a 100-h.p. engine which will be able to deal with 2000 tons
yearly. By this means he will be able to so lower the cost of his
rice as to sell it at St. Louis for 180 francs per ton, instead of
210 francs, the present price. When the Thies-Kayes Railway,
connecting Kayes with the coast, is finished it is thought that it
will be possible for Government to reduce the freights by rail
considerably, and a further fall in the price of Soudan-grown rice
may be confidently looked for.</p>

<p>Owing to the trouble in the engine-room it was found necessary
to wait at Mopti for two days. Here also there was a suitable
opportunity of punishing the malefactors who were responsible for
the breakdown. We were all very pleased to hear that they had been
heavily fined and had had their licences taken away by the
Commissioner.</p>

<p>The night of my arrival I dined with the French officials, and
one of the dishes consisted of some excellent venison, which I was
told was a haunch of wart-hog. It appeared that these beasts were
plentiful in the vicinity of Mopti, so it was arranged the next day
to have a shooting expedition in the wart-hog country. The animals
were on the other bank of the Niger, a very early start being
necessary in order to reach their haunts by daybreak. My French
friends were unable to accompany me at the last moment owing to
pressure of work. At 4 a.m. I started off in pitch darkness, being
paddled down the river in the Government canoe by a couple of
sturdy Bosos.</p>

<p>The air was chilly at that hour as we moved swiftly through the
water. Stillness reigned around us for the first half-hour, until,
about dawn, the phantom shapes of flighting duck and geese began to
show themselves. At the risk of being a bit late for the wart-hog I
could not resist the chance of some sport with the duck on the
river,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span> so I ordered
my canoemen to paddle the craft into a sheltered nook under the
reeds, where I was concealed and in a good position for the birds
as they flew overhead. We were evidently at last getting into the
waterfowl region, for hitherto I had seen but few on the Niger.
After some pleasant sport in which I managed to collect three or
four varieties of duck, besides a goose and some teal, I urged the
canoe boys to hurry on to the spot where I was to land. The sun was
just rising as we stepped ashore at a small village. The country
was a swampy tract along the river bank, such as the wart-hog
delights to roam in. On the west, as the ground became firmer, it
was covered with patches of mimosa bush and low scrub, where the
pig would come and feed in the early morning and evening, while
during the day they made their lair in the low ground. We had not
gone far when a grey object loomed up in the still, uncertain
light, looking so much like the trunk of a mimosa tree that I
hesitated whether or not to fire. The object was not more than
seventy yards away, affording an easy shot. During that interval of
uncertainty I saw the thing suddenly turn and gallop away at a good
pace, settling the question of its identity once and for all! It
certainly was a wart-hog, so I took a flying shot at its retreating
form. It careered on however, untouched, with its tail
contemptuously curled up behind it, in the ludicrous fashion
adopted by these animals when frightened. I had started the morning
badly, and could not help thinking I was unlikely to get another
such easy chance.</p>

<p>Tracks there were in plenty, but it was not till I was well on
my way back that I managed to shoot one. My first indication of his
presence was given by hearing the peculiar grunt to which they give
vent when disturbed. He only trotted a few yards off, however,
before halting to stare at me, thus giving an easy chance. These
animals are very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
stupid and curious; indeed, I think they show more inquisitiveness
than antelopes. I have frequently watched a wart-hog turn round to
stare at his pursuer four or five times before he gets out of
range; the result is, of course, often fatal to him. The curious
excrescences on the beast’s face undoubtedly make him one of the
ugliest of living creatures, and the white, curling tusks
projecting from his jaws tend to enhance his uncouth appearance.
Wart-hog are very plentiful all along the Niger, from Mopti to
Timbuctu. The “Bend” of the river is one of their favourite
habitats, particularly that portion where water is plentiful, and
which is generally called the lake district. I have often seen them
in droves of eight or ten, and have generally found them far from
being wary, so that they are easily approached. Their sight is bad,
but they appear to have a fairly keen sense of smell. I do not
think they have very sharp hearing.</p>

<p>On the way back to the canoe we made a detour through some
grassy country, where I picked up a couple of lesser bustard. I
also saw some greater bustard, but my efforts to approach within
rifle-shot of these very cunning-birds were unavailing. Both kinds
of bustard seemed to be common about here, but the greater was less
common than the lesser species.</p>

<p>At the village on the river bank I had to wait a short while for
the meat of the wart-hog to be brought in. The headman of the place
asked me, with well-meant hospitality, to rest from the heat of the
sun in his house, but after a glimpse inside I decided it was far
cooler and pleasanter under a tree in the open air. The houses in
this part of the country are made of mud, circular in shape, with
roofs of grass thatch. Verandahs are unknown, and as there is but
one small door, ventilation is very indifferent. The houses in the
hot weather are like ovens, for I suppose the temperature in the
day is well over 100 degrees inside<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_165">[165]</span> them. At night the numerous members of a
large family are all crowded together in this small space, so that
I should imagine the atmosphere must be even more intolerable than
by day.</p>

<p>On our way up the river to Mopti I saw several white egrets.
These beautiful birds, which used to abound on the Upper and Middle
Niger, have greatly decreased in numbers during the last few years.
The reason for this is that a great trade in egret feathers used to
be done by French merchants, and thousands of the creatures used to
be slaughtered to supply the market. I was told of several men who
had made considerable fortunes in this way. The practice was
particularly cruel, as the most valuable feathers only grow during
the mating season, the massacre of the birds thus tending rapidly
to wipe out the whole species. The matter was, however, strongly
represented to the French authorities, who took strict measures to
suppress the wanton destruction of egrets on the Niger. A fine of
1000 francs is now imposed on any offender, and the result of this
law has had a most salutary effect in preventing these birds from
being shot, so that it is much to be hoped that in a few years they
may have regained their former numbers. The best feathers are found
on the back, and comparatively few can be obtained from one bird,
consequently a large number of egrets must be killed to produce a
fair “bag” of feathers. Besides the white egret there is also a
grey egret. The latter variety is not so valuable as its white
relation, but the colour is a very beautiful French grey.</p>

<p>At Mopti one of the merchants had a tame lioness. This beast was
quite a cub when it was captured, and the story of its capture is
rather an interesting one. One day when shooting near the river
banks he had killed the mother of a big family of lion cubs, and
was leaving the scene of the exploit when he heard a whining noise
in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span> bush hard
by. On searching in the foliage he discovered this young lioness,
which refused to follow the example of its brothers and sisters who
had all bolted at the report of the rifle. This little beggar
appeared to be heart-broken at its mother’s death, refusing to
leave the spot. She was easily captured, and has been a pet ever
since. She was about twelve months old when I made her
acquaintance, being kept chained up in the courtyard at the back of
the trader’s house. Her owner says she is perfectly harmless, but I
would not feel inclined to trust her very much—her manners were
decidedly rough! She used to play with the dog when younger, and I
was told they were fast companions. A beast of this description is
certainly difficult and expensive to feed when it arrives at
maturity. Our friend in this case used to make a meal off a big
sheep or else two goats daily. She was not given a full ration,
for, as the Frenchman her master explained, if she were too well
fed she would grow so strong as possibly to be unmanageable. I am
afraid that even now she is getting out of hand, and any day may
have to be destroyed to prevent a disaster.</p>

<p>While at Mopti I met a young Frenchman who had been wounded in
rather a strange way when on a hunting expedition. As may be
gathered from the following story he was not very experienced, or
such an accident could never have occurred. He and a friend had
made up a shooting expedition in the same locality where I had been
for wart-hog. They separated at one patch of bush, with the
intention of meeting on the other side. The young fellow, thinking
he would have a lark at his friend’s expense, and apparently never
dreaming of the danger he might incur, made his way through the
bush in the direction of his friend, halting every now and then to
emit a grunt in imitation of a pig. The other sportsman, seeing a
dark object half-concealed in the foliage, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_167">[167]</span> thinking by the noise it made that it
was a wart-hog, fired his rifle. To his horror as the object
dropped it uttered an unmistakably human cry of pain. He then
discovered that he had fired at his friend, wounding him severely
in the leg. Under the circumstances the latter was distinctly
fortunate not to suffer worse injuries. He might very easily have
been killed, and, of course, no blame could have attached to his
companion. The young man had been on crutches for some months at
the time I saw him, but luckily the injury would not permanently
affect him. Another fortunate point in the business was that the
bullet was not a sporting one, but solid-nosed, and simply went
straight through the leg, emerging on the other side without
shattering the bone, as it unquestionably would have done had it
been of a different make.</p>

<p class="sc">A Captive Lioness at Mopti</p>

<p class="justify">This animal was about a year old and had been
brought up from days of cubhood by its owner. The beast had an
uncertain temper, so could scarcely be called an affectionate pet.
She had quite recently sprung on a sheep which had unwarily
wandered within range of her chain, and made a substantial meal off
the carcass!</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Before I left Mopti the Commissioner returned. He had been to
Djenné to buy wood for building the school. It is a strange fact
that at Mopti there is practically no wood. Almost the only wood
suitable for building purposes in this part of the French Soudan,
and indeed for many hundred miles down-stream below Timbuctu, is
the wood of the dum palm. At Djenné this tree grows profusely.</p>

<p>The great enemy of the carpenter in West Africa is the white
ant. This tiny creature has a most voracious appetite for wood, but
certain kinds, amongst others the dum palm and the cocoanut palm,
are impervious to his attacks. White ants always work in large
numbers. They can be seen travelling along in armies of several
thousand, marching in single file or two deep, and following a
little groove or channel which they have excavated for themselves.
Their presence in wood is first detected—if you are lucky—by
observing a narrow streak of earth running along the object they
are attacking. This is in reality a tunnel, which covers them and
affords them shelter while they work at the wood underneath. They
are most persistent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
little creatures, seldom abandoning the object they are devouring
until they have eaten right through it.</p>

<p>If you are not fortunate enough to discover their presence by
the appearance of the earthen tunnel, your first intimation will
probably be given by the sudden collapse of the particular article
upon which they have concentrated their efforts. If this happens to
be one of the uprights which support the roof of your house, even
if you have the good luck to escape without personal injury, it is
trying to suddenly find the building in ruins. Hence the necessity
of using a wood which can resist their onslaughts. Tarring wood
will to a certain extent keep them off, but it is by no mean
reliable. The only way to preserve wooden boxes and similar
articles, which generally rest on the ground, is to put saucers of
water underneath, for the ants will not then be able to climb on to
the wooden surface.</p>

<p>Ants of several species are common in West Africa. Another kind,
which is in many ways more irritating even than the white ant, is
the driver ant. This animal also travels in big armies like the one
already referred to. The “driver” is only found in bush-country. I
never came across it in the drier, sandy soil of the Western
Soudan, where vegetation is not so luxurious as in the countries
nearer the sea-coast. He is brown, and larger than the white ant.
His particular hobby is to bite. He is certainly an adept in the
art of biting, as his unlucky victim soon discovers to his cost.
The “driver” is often seen on a bush path in the daytime, when the
best way of avoiding a close acquaintanceship is to leap over the
track he is following, and then vigorously shake your feet as soon
as you have got well out of his range, for despite all precautions
some of the followers in the army will be fairly certain to have
succeeded in attaching themselves to your legs as you passed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
</p>

<p>But when the “driver” elects to come at night, as he frequently
does, you probably have no warning of his approach until you feel
his bite. Once they have settled on a victim they swarm mercilessly
over him in thousands, and, if left to work their evil will
unmolested, they will not leave the object of their attacks until
they have devoured it. I recollect on one occasion having a very
miserable night owing to “drivers.” I had gone to bed rather tired
after a long day’s march, when I suddenly woke up with unpleasant
stinging pains in my legs. I quickly realized that I had been
attacked by “drivers.” Leaping out of bed and striking a light I
discovered my blankets were covered with a black swarm of these
horrible creatures, several of which had settled themselves on my
limbs with some tenacity. On summoning my servant we tracked the
long line for about a hundred yards down the clearing in which I
was camped to some dank vegetation out of which they were emerging.
The only chance of turning them aside and getting a little sleep
that night was to light a fire across their tracks.</p>

<p>To add to the general discomfort it was pouring with rain, and a
fire was not an easy thing to kindle; however, at the cost of most
of the kerosene of which I was possessed, we managed to light a
fire and head them off. In such cases it is usually the best policy
to shift your camp and leave the ants the masters of the field, for
they are extremely hard to turn aside, and I have seen them put out
a fire by sheer force of numbers. In some parts of the country,
where the natives are pagans and indulge in human sacrifice, a
common method of killing their victim is to tie the individual up,
stripped of clothing, in such a position that movement is
impossible, leaving the “driver” ants to consume the body. The
tortures of such a slow, agonizing death must be terrible. A friend
of mine once had two puppies devoured in this way. His
fox-terrier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span> bitch
had a litter of three puppies one evening, and the following
morning only one remained. The ants had invaded the dog’s basket
during the night, and the mother had only been able to save a
single member of her family from her pertinacious enemies.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="chap_sum">Fulani cattle — Lake Dhebo — Duck shooting —
Teal — A tough bird — The Niger River winds — Towing a barge —
Niafounké — The edge of the Sahara — Stalking birds — Sheep-farming
— Developing the wool trade — Raided by a leopard —
Ostrich-farming.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the 9th of March we left Mopti, finding
considerably more water in this section of the Niger, chiefly due
to the increase in its volume caused by the influx of the Bani. On
both banks there were now wide stretches of rich green grass
springing luxuriantly out of the spongy soil, which even at this
season was covered with several inches of water. Big herds of
Fulani cattle, often immersed to the withers in water, could be
seen grazing as we steamed easily past the banks. The cattle had a
strange appearance, as not much more than their heads were visible,
but stranger still was the cowherd, who, mounted on one of his
beasts, also in the water, the better to supervise their feeding,
urged them on from time to time with weird cries and thwacks from
his staff.</p>

<p>The grass which grows on the banks of the river from Mopti and
away down the Middle Niger is called “borgou.” It is very
fattening, as it contains a large percentage of sugar, hence
probably the fine condition of the herds in this region.</p>

<p>The river was more than ever broken up into creeks and channels;
to me it seemed a hopeless task to know which was the correct one
to follow, so similar and so numerous were they. Often the wider
branches were merely backwaters, running a few miles inland; but
the pilots were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
never puzzled and evidently knew their work well. Sometimes on one
of the swampy banks there would be a large open piece of water,
upon which could be seen myriads of duck and geese revelling in
their feeding-grounds undisturbed by the sportsman.</p>

<p>As we progressed a thick mist began to enshroud the landscape.
We were approaching the great lake, Dhebo, around which this
curious mist generally hangs. About 5.30, just as the sun was
setting, we reached the lake. The entrance is marked by two curious
bare sandstone hills, standing out like sentries above the
surrounding flat country. As the “Réné Caillé” suddenly emerged
from the river as far as the eye could see there was a wide expanse
of water covered with miniature, frothy waves, which, except for
the occasional patches of reeds peering here and there above the
surface, might easily have been mistaken for the sea. The lake,
however, is very shallow. In many places a man could wade across
without much difficulty. Dhebo forms a natural reservoir for the
waters of the Niger in a singular manner. When the rains fall in
the mountains of Tembikunda and Futajallon, in French Guinea, the
Upper Niger naturally rises and the lake fills up. This continues
from about June to October. All this time the Middle Niger, which
has no tributaries, owing to the dearth of mountains and the
proximity of the desert, is getting dry, more especially as rain on
that portion of the river is so infinitesimal in quantity as to be
of no consequence. Towards the end of the rains the lake fills up
and overflows, replenishing the Middle Niger. The overflow from
Dhebo continues to fill up the Middle Niger, but all this time the
upper river is decreasing in volume owing to the cessation of the
rains in the Guinea Mountains. Hence the curious phenomenon is
observed of the Upper Niger subsiding as the Middle Niger
increases, and vice versa. It is for this reason that when the
Upper Niger is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
unnavigable for steam-launches these boats can work on the Middle
Niger.</p>

<p>The “Réné Caillé” had orders to ply only between Mopti and
Kabara (the port of Timbuctu) after this journey, as the water in
the Upper Niger would now be insufficient for her. The bed of the
lake is covered with a kind of river oyster, which is said to be
excellent eating, but I never tried it myself, although we dug up a
number of them as we crossed the place. The skipper was anxious to
make a port on the other shore of Dhebo that night if possible, but
we had entered the lake so late that it was dark very quickly.
Owing to the width of the lake it was hard by day, but impossible
by night, to pick up landmarks by which to steer. The lake being
shallow and sandbanks numerous, steering by the compass was not of
much use, so after many bumps it was decided to anchor for the
night and continue the journey at daybreak. A cold wind blows
nearly all the year round on Dhebo, so that night I was glad of my
blankets for the first time since quitting the Tembikunda
Mountains.</p>

<p>In the morning I was up betimes to have a good view of the lake.
The mist was rising and I could plainly discern a small village
towards which we were steering, and farther ahead still was a wide
silver streak flowing northwards out of the lake. The village was
the fishing-place called Akka, where we were to take in some more
wood, while the river was the Issa-Ber. At this exit of Lake Dhebo
the Niger splits into two large streams, the Issa-Ber and the
Bara-Issa, both of which are navigable, and which reunite at a town
named El Wal-Oueji, about 120 miles further down-stream. The main
branch, and the one we were to follow, was the Issa-Ber. This flows
past the town of Niafounké, whilst the Bara-Issa flows past the
town of Saraféré, where I was to make its acquaintance later, to
the east of the former river. The journey to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_174">[174]</span> Timbuctu by either stream is of about
equal length, but the route by the Issa-Ber is preferable as the
channel is wider.</p>

<p>At Akka I hoped for some duck shooting while the launch was
getting fuel. It was quite early when we anchored off the village,
and I went ashore, gun in hand, accompanied by a couple of the
crew. Behind the place were some likely-looking swamps and small
lakes, whither we bent our steps. Having secured the services of a
local rustic to show us the best spot, I hurried off in order to
make the most of the short time at my disposal. The first place we
approached was surrounded by a fringe of tall reeds, affording
excellent cover for a gun. Near the opposite shore there were a
number of various kinds of duck and teal enjoying the morning air
and unaware of our presence. I instructed my followers to manœuvre
round to the other side, while I cautiously crept into my position
in the reeds on the near bank. The beaters soon began to approach
the birds, amongst whom there were evident signs of unrest, as they
started to chatter and flutter their wings in the water. Presently
up rose a cloud of what looked like white-plumaged birds, which
came flying rapidly towards me; as they circled over my head I had
a right and left at them, bringing down one bird with the first
barrel. They now whirled swiftly away towards the opposite shore,
but before I had reloaded I saw some grey teal rapidly approaching.
I had time for a barrel at them before they were out of range, when
some more duck and then some geese hove in sight.</p>

<p>As soon as the birds returned towards the beaters they were
driven away with loud cries and volleys of stones hurled in the air
in their direction, whereupon they usually circled back towards me,
evidently much disconcerted and unable to understand the unwonted
report of my gun, with the occasional fall of one of their number.
Altogether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span> I had
some capital sport, and was loath to hear the warning whistle of
the launch, indicating that we must gather up the spoil and retrace
our steps. Most of the birds were picked up, and I had collected a
nice little bag. The white-plumaged duck which I had first shot
proved to be a fine big bird, spur-winged, weighing eight or nine
pounds, and although it looked quite white in flight the back was
covered with rich black and dark green feathers.</p>

<p>The grey teal is a beautiful little bird, very swift of flight,
and quite the most delicately flavoured of any waterfowl I shot on
the Niger. This teal has a brown beak and light mottled grey breast
darkening to partridge colour towards the tail. The wings are a
beautiful pearl-grey, while the back is a darker shade of the same
colour. The feet are dark grey. It is common on the swamps and
lakes north of Dhebo. There was another grey teal of about the same
size as the one described, but of a uniform mottled grey partridge
hue. At first I thought it might be the female of the other grey
teal, but I am inclined to think it was quite another species and
was certainly much less common.</p>

<p>The goose I shot was a bird weighing about ten pounds, the wings
and back were copper-coloured, the breast and under surface greyish
white, while the legs were yellow and the beak red. The Bambaras
called it “bio-lou.” This goose was very common north of Mopti; it
is frequently seen feeding in the fields during the daytime. I
cannot recommend it as a dish. The flesh is extremely tough. Even
when well stewed it was almost too hard to be eatable; finally, I
used to use it only for making soup. The largest game bird I saw on
the Niger was a duck which must weigh at least fifteen pounds. It
has a black beak, with a very distinctive red knob on its nose,
just like a Barbary duck. The body and breast are black and white,
while the wings are black, with a dark greenish tinge. This bird is
also spur-winged. It was so large that I used<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_176">[176]</span> to have a joint off it, treating a leg
as one would a leg of mutton.</p>

<p>After leaving Mopti we encountered the Niger River winds. These
winds blow almost permanently from the north-east, that is to say
the general direction is up-stream. The result is that progress
up-stream is frequently more rapid than when one travels with the
current, for in the latter case the wind on this section is
adverse. The wind accounted also for the waves on Lake Dhebo,
making the motion so unpleasant that I could easily believe the
skipper when he said people were often sea-sick here. One or two
barges we passed under sail were spanking along at a great pace
up-stream.</p>

<p>The day before our departure from Mopti a French gentleman had
arrived from Djenné in a lighter. Owing to the strong head winds he
could not make any progress in his craft, so arranged to be towed
by us. He was a newspaper reporter, who had come out from Europe to
study and write a report on certain native tribes of the Western
Soudan. M. Malbranque had made some interesting investigations at
Djenné, and was now <i>en route</i> to Timbuctu for a similar
purpose. His barge was lashed alongside us, so that one could
easily step from one boat to the other. The roof of his lighter
made a pleasant spot upon which to rest and watch the passing
scenery. We used to sit together and have many interesting
discussions about travel. He was a man with a wide experience of
French colonies, who had been in most parts of the world in
connection with his literary labours. His river barge had done a
long journey already. He had started from Koulikoro, some three
weeks before me, but passing to Djenné from the town of Diafarabe,
and then following the Bani River to Mopti.</p>

<p>The Issa-Ber is here nearly half a mile wide, and with such a
fine depth of water that we steamed along merrily,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span> having no longer any fear of
sticking on a shoal. After leaving Lake Dhebo the aspect of the
banks changed considerably. The vast pasturages of “borgou” on the
banks gradually disappeared, giving way to a sandier soil, well
wooded near the water’s edge. As we approached Niafounké the
western shore grew more sandy, while the trees and scrub became
more scattered. Our first view of the station was a glimpse of
three rectangular mud-built houses, standing on rising ground not
far from the river bank, with the Tricolour waving proudly in front
of the centre one. The native town was tucked away in a dip of the
ground behind the Residency, so was not visible from the river.</p>

<p>As we came alongside the little jetty two or three French
officials advanced to meet us. I was introduced to the
Commissioner, his assistant, and the doctor, and invited up to the
Residency, where I was to put up. I had arranged with the skipper
of the “Réné Caillé” to take my surplus baggage on to Timbuctu, as
I intended to travel light, only taking a month’s supplies on my
hunting expedition into the “Bend” of the Niger. I had spent a
pleasant ten days on the little launch, and now said good-bye, for
she was to start off that evening and would travel day and night
till she reached Kabara. The river being now so much wider and
deeper, navigation by night was easy. So the “Réné Caillé” steamed
off, and we went up the hill to the station. My host gave me a most
palatial room in his house, in which I felt lost after living in
half a tiny cabin on the launch for the past few days.</p>

<p>That evening we were a pleasant party of seven. Besides the
officials, two men from a sheep farm had come to dine, and I had to
promise to pay their farm a visit before leaving the neighbourhood.
The doctor and I made great friends. We had much in common, as he
was almost as keen on sport as myself. He had a good deal of
leisure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span> time at
Niafounké and had spent a considerable portion of it in shooting.
We arranged for an expedition the following morning, as I had
decided to pass two days here, giving me time to settle my best
plan of campaign for the future.</p>

<p>The next day we were out before daylight, equipped only with
light rifles, as we did not expect to see anything bigger than
haartebeest, while we would probably only see gazelle.</p>

<p>We were evidently on the edge of the Sahara, for the soil was
very sandy and vegetation of the stunted, desert variety. The trees
were mostly mimosas, and as the sun rose the delicate fragrance of
their golden blossoms was wafted towards us on the morning air.
That morning we did not see much big game, in fact it was not till
we were on the way home that we saw a small herd of red-fronted
gazelle. We each had a rather long shot, and each of us missed.
Small game, however, was abundant. Amongst the mimosa scrub we
frequently saw hares darting about, while sand-grouse were very
numerous. The latter were strangely difficult to see, as they
crouched close to the ground, their speckled yellow colour
harmonizing exactly with the sand in which they lay. They would
sometimes get up almost at one’s feet, unperceived, until one heard
their peculiar cry and the whir of their wings as they swiftly
darted away.</p>

<p>Here I saw the doctor successfully practise the trick of
approaching a greater bustard by stalking it in an ever-narrowing
circle. The plan is an extremely simple and apparently effective
one. The stalker, perceiving the bird at a distance of about 200
yards, proceeds to walk round it slowly in a circle of this radius.
After completing a circle he gradually decreases the diameter,
moving slowly the whole time, until he is within about fifty yards.
At this point he cautiously goes into position with his rifle and
has a shot. The bird does not seem to notice the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span> gradual diminution of
distance, and in this way seems to be fairly easy to approach. It
is certain that to attempt to get within shot in open country is
difficult in any other way.</p>

<p>On the homeward road we passed a small stream where guinea-fowl
and bushfowl were plentiful; indeed, it seemed strange that in this
narrow fringe of country almost bordering on the desert, there
should be such a quantity of small game. We came across several
thorn zaribas, used as sheep-pens by the natives in order to
protect their animals from the lions which prowl around this
region. The doctor informed me that no lions had been seen for some
months past near Niafounké. However, these animals travel great
distances in a short time and they might turn up again unexpectedly
at any minute, so the native is wise to take precautions.</p>

<p>Niafounké is the last district under civil administration on the
Middle Niger. The remainder of the country is administered by the
military authorities. The Resident very kindly gave me one of his
policemen to accompany me till I arrived at Timbuctu. The uniform
of the policeman has a great moral effect on natives, so I was
pleased at having this man to assist me in the villages through
which I would pass. The last afternoon of my stay the doctor and I
went on another shooting excursion. Our plan was to ride out to a
place where we would probably get some wart-hog and gazelle, then
in the evening we were to go on to Gauba, where the sheep farm was,
and where we intended to spend the night with the two men I had met
at dinner the previous day.</p>

<p>We had a pleasant ride, but fortune seemed to have deserted us
much as she had done the day before. My friend had two difficult
shots at a gazelle, but was unsuccessful; while I only saw one
wart-hog when it was too dark to shoot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
</p>

<p>The sheep farm is almost on the Niger banks. It is purely
experimental, being started by Government to try to improve the
breed of the local sheep. The native sheep of the Western Soudan is
not a bad little animal, and gives a fair crop of wool. The wool
is, however, rather coarse, and it was thought that the quality
could be considerably improved by obtaining a better standard of
sheep in the country. Experiments were first tried by breeding from
specially selected animals belonging to the country, but results
were not very encouraging. It was then decided to import from
Algeria a certain number of rams for breeding with the native
sheep.</p>

<p>Before dinner we paid a visit to the sheep-pen. One of our party
was a veterinary officer, who had just arrived to investigate some
sickness which had recently broken out among the animals. There
were forty of these Algerian rams, but unfortunately the sickness
referred to had spread to an alarming extent amongst them, and when
I saw them they were in poor condition. Shearing had been taking
place that day, some very fair samples of wool being shown me. In
spite of their haggard appearance the Algerian rams were decidedly
superior to the West African sheep, the latter looking surprisingly
small and puny in comparison. The enclosure in which the sheep were
penned was a mud wall six feet high, while the only entrance was
closed by a stout wooden door heavily barred. I was struck by the
thickness of the door and asked the reason for such precautions. I
was told that leopards were common in that district, so it was
advisable to secure the sheep against a possible raid. Strange to
relate, that very night we were to have an illustration of the
presence of a leopard!</p>

<p>The natives of this part of the Niger keep big flocks of sheep,
the price of one of these animals being ridiculously small. A big
sheep can be bought for 1 franc 50 cts.,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_181">[181]</span> and the mutton is of quite good quality.
Any science in breeding is, however, totally unknown to these
people, hence the breed is tending to deteriorate. During the cool
season the sheep have plenty of pasturage, but towards the end of
the hot season food is scarce and poor. The French are anxious to
develop their wool trade, hence their efforts to improve the
quality of the wool which is produced in the Western Soudan. For
such articles as rough carpets, blankets, etc., the existing wool
is much used in Europe, but a finer quality is required if the
trade is to be really remunerative.</p>

<p>A white blanket is made from the wool of the Soudan sheep, and
is embroidered with red or green threads. This blanket, although
rough, is a most serviceable article on the cold nights so
frequently experienced in this part of the country. The natives use
them as a covering for themselves by day, and as a bed-wrap at
night. This was the only article manufactured by these people with
their own wool.</p>

<p>Some time after we had retired to bed I was suddenly aroused by
hearing loud exclamations of alarm proceeding from the native
quarter close by. I rushed out with my rifle in hand and was met by
my hosts, also in night attire, the veterinary officer being armed
like myself. A scared negro appeared at this juncture with the news
that a leopard had come into the sheep-pen, having jumped over the
wall, and had carried off a sheep. The alarm had been raised by
hearing a commotion in the pen, and the leopard was actually seen
by one man bounding over the wall with his prey. The vet and I
immediately started off on the frail hope of coming up with the
animal, but as there was no moon the tracks had to be followed by a
lamp. This tedious process led us eventually to some bush, in which
the tracks were completely lost. The following morning the animal’s
pug marks were distinctly<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_182">[182]</span> visible near the house in which we had
slept. It appeared to have circled round the place several times
before it had made its raid on the sheep. After this accident the
wall of the sheep-pen was raised considerably, the top being
covered with a few strands of barbed wire.</p>

<p>A mile from Gauba is the Government ostrich farm. The farm is
managed by a European—who was unfortunately absent when I was
there—and contains about forty birds. These have been caught young
by natives and are kept with a view to breeding. The ostriches give
two crops of feathers annually, in January and June. At present the
farm is only in an experimental state, but it is hoped in time to
produce a large quantity of feathers from the place. The manager
was then on a tour down the Niger in order to try to find a more
suitable site for the farm. It must be near the desert, for
ostriches are more easily obtained from natives there; also, it is
found that the desert air is better suited to the birds, which
produce finer feathers if kept in their natural atmosphere. From
Niafounké down-stream, and upon both banks of the river, ostriches
are found. Sandy country is essential to them, hence in the parts
where there are widely irrigated areas between the rivers Issa-Ber
and Bara-Issa, the birds are not met with. Although ostriches are
fairly numerous in certain parts of the country, it cannot be said
that they are at all common. They are extremely shy birds, thus
being most difficult to approach. Their eyesight is wonderfully
keen. They will perceive you when you are still 600 yards off, and
it requires great patience and energy to successfully stalk them
within practicable rifle range. Their commanding height gives them
a great advantage when pursued by man, and the speed with which
their long legs can cover the ground is astonishing. Ostriches will
easily outstrip a galloping horse, consequently the only way to
approach them is by wile, although<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_183">[183]</span> I have been told that sometimes they can be
worn down by persistent pursuit on horseback.</p>

<p>Of desert vegetation they seem to prefer a plant somewhat
resembling a pumpkin, which creeps on the ground. On this they are
fed chiefly at the ostrich farm, but, of course, an ostrich will
eat almost anything, and I fancy their diet is not a matter needing
much care and forethought. It is a curious fact that ostrich
feathers are nearly as expensive in the French Soudan as they are
in England. On several occasions I bought some, but they were so
high in price as really hardly to be worth buying. The truth is
that ostrich hunting in the Western Soudan is in such an
undeveloped state that the natives who have feathers for sale ask
fancy prices, and usually get them.</p>

<p>The ostrich farm near Niafounké is not well placed and the
situation is certain soon to be changed.</p>

<p>My plans were now to try for lion along the banks of the Niger,
near a place called Sébi, and afterwards to make for Saraere, where
there was also the possibility of lion, and finally to march to
Lake Bambara Maaundé, a fine hunting locality for elephant and
several varieties of big game. Most of the inhabitants here are
Fulanis, and their occupation is tending big herds of cattle. The
country is thinly populated, and thus is well suited for game. A
horse was essential for shooting, but I was unable to buy one, so
had to be content for the present with hiring daily from village to
village—a troublesome and unsatisfactory proceeding.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the 13th of March I left Gauba. For the
first few miles our way lay through a swampy country, consisting of
creeks and backwaters of the Niger, or to be more accurate, of the
Issa-Ber. Hundreds of waterfowl of all descriptions were preening
their feathers in the morning sun, sitting in groups on the little
islands in the middle of the streams or floating lazily near the
banks, watching us with suspicious looks as we approached. Numerous
game tracks led down to the water’s edge, the footprints showing
clearly in the soft soil. Waterbuck and kob appeared to frequent
these haunts in the early morning, while wart-hog were very common.
Allowing my carriers to go on, I was able to secure some good
specimens without proceeding far into the bush on the higher ground
to the west of our road.</p>

<p>On arriving at the village of Sibo I was told that further
progress by road was impossible, as the floods had been high that
year and the track was still under water. The only course to adopt
was to go by canoe. Hiring a canoe or any business transaction is
always a lengthy proceeding where the West African native is
concerned. The chief of the place had first to be summoned, and, of
course, was not to be found for some time. The virtue of patience
is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span> indeed, a
golden one to possess in this land. The native’s methods are
invariably dilatory since time has no value for him. But it is easy
to preach patience and a great deal harder to practise it when one
is in a hurry to get things done. In this case I was kept waiting a
couple of hours before the chief arrived. The policeman provided by
the Commissioner at Niafounké had unfortunately not yet reached me,
but was to do so during the course of that morning. When the chief
had arrived a considerable discussion took place between his
insubordinate followers as to which one should supply the craft,
until I cut matters short by securing the best canoe I could find
and telling the chief I would send him back to Niafounké with a
message to the Commissioner unless the paddlers were forthcoming
within half an hour. Matters were at length settled, and my few
belongings quickly stowed on board.</p>

<p>Mamadu had secured a large earthenware pot, a very necessary
article for culinary purposes in a wooden canoe, as the fire had to
be lighted in this receptacle, and we were just shoving-off when
the policeman cantered up on his steed. As it was not possible to
take this beast on the canoe it had to be left at the village.</p>

<p>The canoe was about twenty feet long, leaked considerably and
had no awning, so I looked forward to a hot and uncomfortable
journey. My expectations were fully realized. In spite of two men
being constantly on duty to bale out, we made so much water that at
one time I feared we would have to run ashore and patch her up
before the voyage could be continued. The sun, too, was very trying
that day. It poured its rays mercilessly upon our heads until at
last I was driven to take refuge, in a rather ignominious fashion,
by lying at full length on my back, and placing my camp-table
across two seats I was able to get a little welcome shade
underneath it. The chief discomfort of my position was due to the
water at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span> the bottom
of the boat, so that I was immersed in a perpetual bath.</p>

<p>We were now in the Issa-Ber. The banks were sandy, and scrub was
scanty and stunted. The river is nearly a mile wide in many places,
and frequently too deep for poling to be effective. These canoes
are manipulated in two ways, either by paddles or poles. The
canoemen are expert at both these methods, but, owing to the strong
wind which is so prevalent, it is often hard work to make much
progress with paddles. The poles are merely long bamboos or palm
stalks, and with these the craft can be propelled in the shallower
water near the banks. When poling, we constantly found further
progress barred by thick masses of “borgou” grass. This grass has
its roots often twelve or fifteen feet deep in the water; it grows
so densely that it makes a thick matting from the surface of the
water downwards, through which it is extremely difficult to
penetrate. The appearance is somewhat similar to “sudd,” found on
other rivers in the tropics; and in many of the streams where
navigation is not frequent the whole channel is blocked, so that
the only successful means of dealing with it would appear to be to
have a small steamer fitted with a cutting apparatus to hew a
channel for itself as it moves through the water.</p>

<p>My servant could not speak Fulani or Sonrhai, the two languages
now required, so I found the policeman doubly useful; indeed,
without him it would have been hard to get anything done.</p>

<p>In several places we saw fish tanks, made on the edge of the
river banks, where the “borgou” was clearer or had been cut away by
the natives. Fish were first caught in traps or nets and then
stored in the tank alive. The riverside people are great consumers
of dried fish, live ones being taken out of the tanks as
requirements dictated, to be dried for local consumption or for
trade at neighbouring<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_187">[187]</span> inland markets. At the time these fish were
being dried on the river banks the stench proceeding from them was
most unpleasant, making it necessary to give the shore a wide
berth.</p>

<p>My recollections of Sébi are that it was one of the hottest and
dirtiest villages of the Western Soudan. I camped on the eastern
side of the town, but had occasion to enter it several times during
my stay in the place. The chief provided me with two hunters, who
could give me no immediate information of lion. There was no doubt,
however, that I was as likely to see them here as anywhere, for the
record of cows and sheep killed in this locality by “the king of
beasts” was far higher than anywhere else in the “Bend.” A week
before my arrival there had been a kill, and it was quite likely
that lion would soon revisit this happy hunting-ground. The local
herdsmen were told to send me immediate news of any signs of the
presence of lion which might be observed near their flocks; one
hunter was sent to seek for fresh tracks near the river, south of
the town, while I and the other hunter went off next morning to a
likely haunt to the north.</p>

<p>Three days brought no information of lion in the vicinity, but
that they had recently been there was certain, for I came across
tracks, varying from a week to a fortnight in age, of three
different animals within ten miles of the town. I have not the
slightest doubt that had I not been so pressed for time, and been
able to prolong my stay for a week or two, I would have been
certain to get at least one. Knowing, however, that I should
probably get a chance soon, for all the country in the “Bend” is
fairly plentiful in lion, I made preparations for my departure to
Saraféré. My stay at Sébi had not been unproductive, as I had shot
a nice kob and a red-fronted gazelle, which in size was within an
eighth of an inch of the record, besides several smaller heads of
different varieties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
</p>

<p>At Sébi there was quite the best duck, geese and teal shooting I
found anywhere on the Niger. At the back of the town there were
several large ponds and marshy rivulets in which swarms of birds
were always to be seen, while at night, about sunset, the waterfowl
could be shot flighting between the Niger and these places. Each
evening I went out with my shot-gun, and had some capital sport on
every occasion. Just when the light was getting dim the noise of
the whir of many wings would be heard in the air, when, on looking
up, a cloud of dusky objects might be seen approaching phantom-like
in the sky. The first shot would cause them to swerve, passing away
out of shot, but behind were line upon line of serried ranks, all
directing their flight towards the same objective, unaware of the
danger below them, until they heard the report of a gun and,
perhaps, saw one of their number fall to the ground. Quite apart
from lion or other big game, Sébi was decidedly worth a visit for
the sport of its wildfowl shooting.</p>

<p>From Sébi I was told that my shortest way was by canoe, but I
did not place much confidence in my information, for the water in
the small creeks, by which I must travel, was subsiding so rapidly
that it seemed highly probable I should find myself stranded before
I had gone very far on my journey. Besides, I was anxious to see
more of the country, and this could best be done on horseback. I
had brought no such luxury as an English saddle and bridle on my
expedition, so I had to get accustomed to the native horse
equipment. To anyone who wishes to try it I say most advisedly,
“Don’t.” Of course, one can get used to anything, but the tortures
suffered in accustoming oneself to a native saddle in the Western
Soudan are such that the game is decidedly not worth the candle. By
perseverance, and with the loss of a good deal of temper, I did get
used to the thing eventually, only, many was the time<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span> I groaned at the thought of
another day in that saddle and prayed even for the roughest of
English-made saddles.</p>

<p>The native saddle is made entirely of wood; even if the wood
were well-planed and with a level surface it would be endurable,
but the wood is roughly hewn and appears to be fashioned in a
series of little hills and dales, which are most fiendish
contrivances for a person only possessed of normal skin. To add to
the discomfort the saddle is seldom made out of one piece of wood,
but the seat consists of two or three planks which frequently do
not fit over-well against each other. A blanket thrown across it
can do something to alleviate one’s miseries, but at the best it is
a poor remedy, and a very hot one.</p>

<p>Mamadu was very anxious to ride, so I let him hire a horse too.
His horsemanship was very inferior, however, and after several
differences of opinion between himself and his mount, ending
invariably in his discomfiture, he came to the conclusion that he
preferred walking. Mamadu certainly did cut a strange figure on a
horse, his appearance causing much merriment to the whole party. At
this time he had, from somewhere or other, unearthed a long, black
coat, which had seen better days and was now very threadbare. This
garment covered his white coat, coming half-way down his white
baggy trousers as well. His head was adorned by a native sun-hat, a
conical affair, gaily decorated with coloured leather ribbons. On
horseback his appearance was even more ludicrous than it was on
foot, and when he used to prepare to mount he was greeted with loud
yells of derision from the carriers, who considered him fair game
for a jest. Poor Mamadu, his troubles were great in those days, and
I am afraid I did not feel as much sympathy for him as I perhaps
should have done.</p>

<p>I used to ride on with the policeman in the morning, ahead of
the carriers, the policeman carrying my shot-gun,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span> while I had my rifle slung
over my shoulder. In this way one could get a good deal of sport on
the road. On observing any game I would dismount, leaving my horse
with the policeman, and was then free to stalk at my leisure. The
country was very open, with no other trees than stunted dum palms,
and sandy soil. For miles upon miles it was a flat plain, watered
with numerous shallow, slowly flowing streams, which fertilized the
country between the rivers Issa-ber and Bara-Issa, and connected
those two main waterways.</p>

<p>The track was ill-defined, so that I found it necessary to take
a guide from village to village. Cattle-tracks crossed and
recrossed our path in every direction, in many cases completely
obliterating all signs of the way we were endeavouring to follow.
Moreover, wide detours had constantly to be made to avoid
inundations, of which only the nearest villages were aware. These
inundations were very deceptive. Some were fordable, but others had
a treacherous quagmire under the surface of the water, from which
it would be no easy matter to extricate oneself. On approaching
these inundated areas we would disturb big flocks of teal, which
had been hidden in the rushes, and now circled high over our heads
waiting for our departure to settle down once more in their
accustomed haunts.</p>

<p>The villages were all Fulani. These people, although in many
ways superior to the other inhabitants of the Western Soudan, live
in far inferior houses. When approaching a place a glance will be
sufficient to tell if it is inhabited by Fulanis. Their huts are
most primitive and flimsy affairs. They are built of plaited straw,
which is the stalk of the rice or millet plant. There is only one
layer of this straw, so that sun or rain can penetrate with
ease.</p>

<p>These huts are very low, there being only just room for a man to
stand upright in the centre. At one end is a<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_191">[191]</span> couch, made of a few layers of sticks
and raised two feet off the ground. The couch is generally covered
with grass mats and tanned sheepskins. The entrance is by an
opening barely three feet high, while, if the ground is rough, it
is usually covered with more grass mats. Fulani villages are very
dirty. The people live with their cattle around them. In the
daytime the young calves are to be seen tied up to a stake at the
front door, to prevent their following their mothers, which are
sent out to graze with the rest of the herd. At sunset the whole
troop return, when the village resounds with their lowing and
bellowing. When green fodder is dried up the cattle are fed on the
same straw of which the huts are made.</p>

<p>In all this country supplies are wonderfully plentiful and
cheap. Fowls can be bought for 15 cts.; eggs cost 10 cts. for four;
milk is about a halfpenny a quart; and a bullock can be bought for
20 francs. For this reason living is as inexpensive as anywhere in
the world, I should think, so long as the traveller lives on local
produce. Freight from the coast is so high, however, that European
stores are most expensive. Between Niafounké and Timbuctu the
French reckon that a loaf of bread, baked with French flour, costs
them 1 franc 50 cts. The French being great eaters of bread grumble
greatly at the cost of flour in those parts.</p>

<p>Five miles from Saraféré we had to cross a wide swamp by canoe.
On the other side of this water was a fair road, coming from the
west; this was the road from Niafounké to Saraféré, and this we now
followed till the town was reached.</p>

<p>Saraféré lies on the opposite shore of the River Bara-Issa,
which here is a couple of hundred yards wide. The river twists and
winds around the town in a curious manner, describing a curve
resembling the letter “W.” As the crow flies the distance between
the outer bends of the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_192">[192]</span> “W” cannot be more than a couple of hundred
yards, but by the river it must be fully five miles. The town
itself consists of a strange collection of mud-built houses, of
rather Moorish appearance. The streets are quaint, narrow alleys,
winding in an aimless fashion through the place. All the houses
have flat roofs, upon which the better-class citizens take the
evening air.</p>

<p>Saraféré is called the Sister of Timbuctu, owing to the
similarity existing between the two towns. The inhabitants are
mostly Sonrhais, but the place is divided into quarters for Arabs,
Fulanis, Bambaras, Bosos and Tuaregs, all of which races are fairly
well represented. Besides all these permanent residents there is a
floating population of traders from all parts of Western Soudan.
Mossis from the south bring native cloths and kola nuts, chiefly
the product of the big market of Wagadugu. Moors and Tuaregs bring
salt and gum from the desert regions in the north. Sonrhais from
Djenné take spice and native peppers to Saraféré market, while
Hausas from Kano, to the east, bring beads, sham pearls and Kano
leather wares. This mixture of different races, talking different
languages, makes Saraféré market-place an interesting scene to the
European visitor.</p>

<p>The Resident’s house and those of the two French merchants face
the river, occupying a large space in front of the town. Here one
gets a foretaste of the desert winds. Clouds of sand envelop the
town during the months of March, April and May, making existence
anything but pleasant while the wind is blowing. The sand permeates
every nook and cranny of a house. The only thing to do is to shut
all doors and windows, enduring the heat in preference to being
buried in sand. The soil on the immediate banks of the river is
capable of producing good rice and millet, but away from the water
it is poor and desert-like. Long stretches of sand, with only here
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span> there a few
dried-up shrubs or tufts of coarse grass, characterize this rather
forbidding-looking land.</p>

<p>The Sahara has, indeed, invaded the right bank of the Niger, not
content with the havoc it has wrought along the left bank of the
river. Much of the country in the “Bend” bids fair to develop into
desert in the course of time unless these terrible winds can be
checked. Nature opposes no obstacle to them, as the land is so
flat, almost uninterruptedly from the southern slopes of the Atlas
Mountains across the whole of this portion of Northern Africa. But
I am rather digressing, for that part of my story belongs really to
the description of the country near Timbuctu and the other side of
the Niger.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of canoes on the Niger, the “Djenné” and the
“Niger” canoe. While I was at Saraféré I had ample opportunity for
watching the building of the latter kind of craft. The whole
material for the canoe is produced from the dum palm. It is
interesting to observe the uses the different portions of that tree
can be put to in the manufacture of a canoe. As the dum palm is
practically the only tree found in the country it is fortunate for
the natives that it has so many varied uses.</p>

<p>A canoe made of this palm cannot be constructed out of one
piece, as a dug-out is hewn from a single tree trunk. This is not
possible, because the trunk of the dum palm is of small diameter,
and several trees must be utilized to make a single canoe. Most
canoes are made of six separate portions of the wood, sewn
together, but of course, the number of pieces required varies with
the size of the craft to be built. The first operation is roughly
to hew the different parts of the frame into the required shape.
The tools used are an instrument resembling a chisel and an
iron-headed hammer. These tools are of native make, forged roughly
by a native blacksmith, so hardly the most suitable for the work
they are required to perform. However,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_194">[194]</span> ever, the result is not by any means bad,
doing great credit to the skill of the workmen. When the portions
of the body have been shaped, they are placed together, being kept
in position by logs of wood propped against them. The next
operation is to sew these portions together. Holes are punched with
a sharp-pointed instrument through the pieces near their edges, the
local rope being used to bind the parts together by threading it
through these holes.</p>

<p>The local rope is made out of strips of the stalk of the palm
leaf. These strips are plaited together until they form a kind of
withy, which is exceedingly strong and durable. The holes in the
frame are stopped up by taking as many turns of rope as possible
through them, but of necessity there is plenty of space left
between the stitches for water to leak through.</p>

<p>The next item is to stop these holes more effectively, for it
would be impossible to remain long in the water in a canoe which
leaked so badly as the unfinished article now would do. For this
purpose the leaves themselves of the palm trees are utilized. These
leaves are very fibrous in texture. This fibre is pounded up until
it becomes a stringy, yellowish mass, quite soft and easily
manipulated. Small bits of this stuff are poked into all existing
crevices until no gaps are discernible. It only now remains to
smooth off the rough surfaces of the canoe, and to put in seats,
etc. Even the best canoes leak a great deal, but a constant supply
of the fibre referred to is kept on board for the purpose of
stopping the more serious leaks, and a man is frequently engaged in
baling out. These canoes rarely last more than one year, but
building is so simple and all materials so near to hand that there
is no great difficulty in building new ones.</p>

<p>The “Djenné” canoe is more elegantly shaped and much better
finished. There is no mistaking a “Djenné” canoe when seen on the
river. In actual construction the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_195">[195]</span> only difference is that the Djenné people
use wooden pegs to connect the separate parts of the body together
instead of sewing them. Canoes sixty feet long are frequently seen
on the Niger. They usually belong to a native trader, or to a rich
chief. They invariably are covered over with native mats, forming
an awning as a shelter from the weather. The native canoe is of
very shallow draught. I doubt if it draws more than three inches.
All the river people are expert paddlers and polers. They will, if
necessary, travel day and night without more than three hours’ halt
in the twenty-four, and will keep this up for five or six days
continuously. Canoes trade for long distances on the Niger. They
frequently ply between Timbuctu and Koulikoro, a distance of nearly
600 miles. The Saraféré canoes usually trade only with Timbuctu to
the north, or Djenné to the south. While I was at Saraféré several
canoes came from Djenné bringing traders with the produce of their
country. The water in the river towards Timbuctu happened to be
rather low at the time I was at Saraféré, so only small canoes were
trading between the two towns.</p>

<div>
<p class="sc">Bambarra Hunters in the “Bend” of the Niger</p>

<p class="justify">These men were my native trackers when I was
hunting big game in the Middle Niger Basin. The picturesque figure
in the centre is a splendid specimen of the Bambarra race. The
horns strung round his middle are not powder-flasks, but charms, to
each of which some particular virtue is supposed to attach, for
these people are steeped in superstition.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The women of the place fashion clay pots out of the mud found on
the banks of the Bara-Issa. These pots are very simple in design,
but are useful as water coolers.</p>

<p>The finest men found in this country are certainly the hunters.
They are brawny fellows, of fine stature and hard muscles. Their
eyes are keen through long practice in following game, while their
powers of tracking are undeniable. In the course of my hunting
expeditions I came in contact with a good many of them, and one
could not but admire their strength and endurance. The hunters are
nearly all Bambaras, living in small groups in the different
villages. They exist entirely by what they can shoot; although I
must own that I was hardly impressed with their prowess with the
gun. On one occasion I<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_196">[196]</span> recollect seeing my head hunter stalk a
gazelle. I and the other hunters were spectators from the fringe of
some bushes about two hundred yards away. The gazelle was quietly
browsing in an open piece of ground with little available cover
between it and its stalker. Nothing could exceed the skill with
which he crossed the intervening ground unperceived, until he had
taken up a position not ten yards from the animal, concealed by a
friendly small shrub. It was really a fine piece of stalking; it
seemed almost incredible that he could have approached so close
unknown to his intended victim.</p>

<p>Breathlessly I watched the scene through my glasses, fully
expecting that the unfortunate little animal would be blown to
smithereens at such short range.</p>

<p>There was a deafening report, but when the smoke cleared I was
astonished to see the gazelle bounding away at the top of its speed
quite scathless!</p>

<p>The hunter did not appear to be much mortified by his failure,
so I could only suppose it was not an unusual occurrence for game
to be missed at such close range.</p>

<p>These hunters are all armed with old flint-lock guns, rather
formidable-looking weapons, but often more dangerous to the owner
than to the object fired at. They are five feet in length, with
barrels made out of old gas-pipes or anything that comes handy.
Missfires are frequent owing to indifferent powder, and the weapon
has to be fired from the hip as the recoil is so violent. The guns
are first loaded with a big charge of black powder, extending some
inches up the barrel. A piece of old cloth is then rammed down to
keep the powder in position. The shot comes next, consisting of a
varied assortment of stones, bits of lead, scraps of iron, etc.,
the whole charge being rammed home with a piece of rag, and
extending three-quarters of the way up the barrel. The tendency is
for the missiles to fly high and scatter; but, if fairly aimed, the
damage done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span> is
considerable, as instead of inflicting a single wound, possibly
some dozen pellets strike the victim.</p>

<p class="sc">Canoes on the River Bara-Issa</p>

<p class="justify">Most of the inhabitants of the river-banks are
occupied in trade with Timbuctu, Mopti, and Djenné, or else are
fisherfolk; consequently they spend a great portion of their lives
in canoes. These canoes are roomy and provided with overhead
shelters as a protection from the sun.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was while I was near Saraféré that I got my lion. One
afternoon I heard news of a lion having been seen that morning,
about fifteen miles from my camp. He had attacked a herd of Fulani
cattle, making off with one of the cows.</p>

<p>I lost no time in setting out for the village nearest to the
scene of the “kill.” I rode off with a guide to show the way,
leaving my kit to follow me the same evening. That night I camped
at the village to which the cow belonged.</p>

<p>There seemed every prospect of my finding the lion the following
morning, for he would probably despatch his meal in his lair hard
by, and rest there to sleep off the effects for some hours.</p>

<p>Accompanied by my two hunters and a native who knew the spot, I
set out before daylight. We had to cross a stream which lay between
the village and the place where the cow had been killed. On the
other side was a sandy scrub country, dotted about with the
ever-present dum palms. These palms here grew in clumps, some of
which were a hundred yards in diameter, but the palms themselves
were more in the nature of bushes, and not more than twelve feet
high. It was beginning to get light, but the undergrowth in these
clumps was so thick that one could seldom see more than a few yards
inside. These clumps were the lair of the lion, although it was not
certain in which one he would then be found.</p>

<p>After tracking him from his “kill” for some distance, we
discovered the place where he had dragged the remains of his
victim. However, it was soon evident that he had since emerged from
there, and we now followed his pug marks of that morning, clearly
defined in the sandy soil. At last he was traced to a certain
clump, thicker than the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_198">[198]</span> rest, in which he certainly was lying. It
being impossible to see inside, the only plan was to try to
frighten the brute out. Accordingly I sent the beater and hunters
to different points, where, at a given signal, they were to
commence to shout and beat the bush with the object of driving him
towards me. The ruse succeeded in causing him to bound out of his
hiding-place, but unfortunately on the opposite side to me, so that
I never saw him. I dashed round to the far side and just caught a
glimpse of him disappearing towards another clump of palms.</p>

<p>Now ensued a curious race between us and the lion. I knew that,
should I lose sight of him for long, he would probably give me the
slip, for these beasts travel great distances when alarmed.</p>

<p>We accordingly pursued him at our best speed, until he was
viewed disappearing into another clump. Again he got away before I
had a chance of a shot. This race continued for another mile or so,
when I was decidedly winded and the perspiration streaming off me.
At last I came up with the beast, in a palm grove, and, cautiously
following his tracks into the bush for a few paces, I suddenly saw
him, in a more open spot than usual, about forty yards away.</p>

<p>He stood facing me, his splendid eyes glaring wickedly, while he
lashed his tail and uttered some low roars.</p>

<p>Here was a fine opportunity; so, raising my ·450 rifle, I fired,
and he dropped with a bullet through his head.</p>

<p>Keen as I was, I do not think I could have maintained the race
much longer, for I was quite winded and had some difficulty in
keeping my rifle steady as I fired; but the range was so close, and
I could see him so distinctly, that the shot was an easy one.</p>

<p>The lion of this country is not a handsome creature. The colour
is a pale tawny, and the animal is maneless. Moreover, it is my
firm conviction that he is an arrant<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_199">[199]</span> coward. My own experience, and what the
Fulani herdsmen have told me, both tend to support this idea. I
have been told more than once of cases in which a lion had jumped
on one of the herd with the intention of killing and carrying off
its prey, but had been driven off by a single-handed Fulah armed
merely with a stick. It seems rather ridiculous that a lion can be
frightened off his victim, by thwacking him with a stick, but there
is no doubt that it has been often done by these people.</p>

<p>The Fulanis hold the lion in contempt rather than in awe, and, I
fancy, he only succeeds as a rule in securing his prey because the
herds are too large for one man to supervise.</p>

<p>These Fulanis, whom one meets so often in the Western Soudan,
are an interesting race of people.</p>

<p>They are certainly not of negro origin, for they have straight
hair, aquiline features, thin lips, and pale reddish brown skins.
There is a mystery about the land of their forefathers, but it
cannot have been in Western Africa. Some people say they came
originally from Egypt. To support this theory it is stated that the
word “Fulah” is a corruption of the word “Felah” of Egypt. Their
appearance is somewhat Egyptian also. On the other hand, it is not
easy to trace a close connection between their language and customs
and those of Egypt.</p>

<p>Many maintain that they came from the other side of the Red Sea.
Their own version of their history is exceedingly vague. Anyhow, it
seems clear that they came from the East, as they have left traces
of their progress from the East to the West of Africa. They are far
superior in intellect to the negro, having shown their superiority
by conquering all with whom they have come in contact. They are
essentially a pastoral people, whose chief object in life appears
to be to excel in the size of their herds. Their dwelling-places
are generally temporary ones, where<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_200">[200]</span> they stay as long as the pasturage is
sufficient for their cattle. As soon as the grass gets poor they
shift their dwellings to more favourable spots. The Fulah counts
his wealth by his bulls and cows. All the money he makes is laid
out in increasing his stock. He has a wonderful knowledge of
cattle, and a marvellous power of calling to strayed animals. By
uttering some weird low cry they can recall their beasts even from
considerable distances.</p>

<p>Fulanis have made their way almost to the coast. They are found
in many places in small colonies, generally forming the
cattle-owning population of a place. The province of Futa-Jallon in
French Guinea is inhabited by them, otherwise they have no big
strongholds until the Middle Niger is reached. But from there to
Northern Nigeria they are found in certain places in considerable
numbers. Except for tending cattle they do no work themselves,
being decidedly indolent. The housework and any farm work are
entirely done by slaves, or servants. Slaves are well treated by
them, and many slaves stay with their masters in serfdom in
preference to taking their liberty, which they can do at any time
they wish, by making a statement to this effect before a French
Commissioner.</p>

<p>The Fulanis are all fervent Mohammedans. Wherever there are
Fulanis there will be found a mosque. These people have shown
themselves able administrators in the places which they governed
before the advent of the white man. Their laws were just, while
their method of appointing civil administrators to the various
districts into which a country was subdivided was sound. It would
be interesting to know more about the past of these people, and it
is much to be hoped that further light may one day be thrown on
their origin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="chap_sum">Land near the Bara-Issa — Tuaregs — A salt
caravan — Stalking hartebeest — Lake Niangaye — The village of
Kanioumé — My runaway horse — Tracking elephants — Elephants
bathing — A stampede of elephants — A wounded elephant — Cave
dwellers — Sandstorms and rifles.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the 21st of March I left Saraféré. I had
managed to buy a horse here, being glad to have my own mount at
last. He was a little animal, a dark bay, about fourteen hands; not
exactly the most suitable beast for the work for which I required
him, but horses were not easy to buy. In any case, the price could
not be called exorbitant. I paid the sum of seventy-five francs, or
three pounds, for him, the saddle and bridle included!</p>

<p>I still had to be content with a native saddle and bridle, for
European horse-gear was not to be had in the Western Soudan. His
previous owner was a native clerk in the Resident’s office, who
informed me that he was selling as he proposed closing his stables!
Fortunately I was a light weight, and as he appeared to be a wiry
little beggar in spite of his somewhat weedy looks, I came to the
conclusion he would be good enough for what was expected of him. He
was, of course, innocent of any knowledge of trotting. His only two
paces were an amble and a walk. He could amble fast or he could
amble slow, but had not much idea of galloping.</p>

<p>The country was very similar to that between Sébi and Saraféré.
In the season of inundations it would not have been practicable to
travel by road, as the existing track would have been several feet
deep in water. The only mode<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_202">[202]</span> of transport then possible is by canoe.
Rice and millet are the products of this country, the land near the
streams and backwaters of the Bara-Issa being eminently suited to
the cultivation of these cereals. On the banks of these streams are
the villages, but as soon as one strikes into the interior, away
from the water, the country becomes more than ever desert-like in
character, and human habitations are confined to a few isolated
Tuareg encampments. The people in the villages are Fulanis, as
usual possessed of big herds of cattle. The Tuaregs, on the other
hand, owned sheep and goats, which seemed to thrive in a marvellous
manner on the poor provender found in the sandy waste surrounding
them. A coarse-looking grass, or mimosa scrub, formed their
fare.</p>

<p>These Tuaregs are hardly the same class of that tribe as are
found in the desert proper on the other side of the Niger. They are
nomads, preferring the isolated life away from villages, it is
true, but at the same time they do not so utterly shun all contact
with mankind as do their brethren of the Sahara. I suppose being
nearer to civilization and luxuries, they have begun to feel the
want of these things, and have to a certain extent degenerated.
Anyway, they would appear to be now less hardy than before. Their
dwelling-places consist either of small tents made of sheepskins,
or else of little huts made of branches of mimosa scrub and palm
leaves. Hut is rather a dignified name to apply to these
habitations. They are, perhaps, a dozen feet square, and so low
that a man must always remain in a crouched position if he tries to
stand up inside. It is strange how they succeed in getting their
wives and families into this tiny space. Certainly their personal
belongings are few, for they are very poor, and their wealth, such
as it is, is all in their flocks of goats or sheep.</p>

<p>One day we met a large salt caravan coming down from Timbuctu,
and <i>en route</i> to a place called Douentza, some<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span> days’ march south of Saraféré.
The salt is carried in big rectangular bars, and, in this case, was
laden on donkeys and bullocks. The loads are usually fastened into
a kind of stout rope netting, like a bag. These nets are then
fastened one on each side of the beast of burden, over a roughly
shaped pack-saddle.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>These traders were all Hausas, travelling with their wives and
children. They cover about fifteen miles a day in this manner, and
are so abstemious in their habits that they generally make a large
profit on their transactions. They drink only water as a rule,
while their diet is of the most frugal kind, helped out with a few
kola nuts, of which they are exceedingly fond. The nut has rather a
bitter taste, but one soon gets accustomed to it. The Hausas can
exist without food for a considerable time, provided they have some
kola nut to chew. There is no doubt that its sustaining properties
are great, while, when water has been scarce, I have found it a
first-rate plan to keep a piece of the fruit in one’s mouth and
close the teeth on it.</p>

<p>The head of this caravan was a native merchant of some
importance. Early next morning we saw him on the road preparing to
start. He wore flowing white robes, and made a picturesque figure
mounted on his gaily caparisoned steed. I was informed he was a
regular trader by that route, and that he always personally
superintended the assembly of his caravan before the morning
departure. He certainly seemed to have a rather motley collection
of both sexes who were under him in perfect control. At his orders
they sought out, without much delay, their respective beasts from
the grass where they were browsing, and loaded their charges in a
most business-like manner.</p>

<p>This place, called Bouramaka-Yororo, was one of the few spots
where I saw any full snipe. About two miles’ walk from the village
there were some shallow ponds, with marshy banks, which were the
homes of these snipe,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_204">[204]</span> besides quantities of the grey teal, which
I previously described. Most of the different kinds of duck, which
I had come across before, were also well represented, but in
comparison to the grey teal their numbers were insignificant. The
water was covered with a grey sheet of these little birds, but they
were very wild, and rose in the air in dense clouds on observing
our approach.</p>

<p>The next day we had a long march, through a very sandy region,
to the western extremity of Lake Niangaye. We had now left the
water system of the River Bara-Issa behind us, and the country was
destitute of water until the lake was reached.</p>

<p>I was riding ahead of the carriers with the policeman, as my
custom was, when, as we came round a bend in the track, we espied a
big herd of Senegal haartebeest. The animals had evidently been
down towards the lake, and on perceiving us, galloped off through
the scrub to our right front. There were at least forty in the
herd, and, in the hopes that they had not gone too far for pursuit,
I started off on their tracks. The trail was easy enough to follow,
so, leaving the police orderly with our horses, I went off alone.
The ground sloped gently in front of me, so I cautiously approached
the top, expecting to see the antelope grazing on the far side.
Working with the wind in my face, I wended my way gradually to the
ridge, and, taking cover behind a mimosa tree, I peered warily over
the edge. Sure enough, about eight hundred yards away were the
herd, some grazing, while others had their heads turned in the
direction from which they had come, evidently not forgetful of the
alarm our appearance had caused among them.</p>

<p>I now tried to stalk them by a flank movement, making for a
hillock within two hundred yards of the game. Here I hoped to be
able to select the best head, and should be within fairly good
range. My manœuvring was completely<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_205">[205]</span> successful until I neared the top of the
hillock, and then, by an incautious movement, I foolishly exposed
myself to view for a fraction of a second. To my disgust I had been
observed, and away scampered the whole herd at a pace which I knew
meant that pursuit was out of the question. I took a couple of
flying shots at the one I had marked down as being the biggest
bull, but they were both clean misses, and I was unable to retrieve
the blunder I had made by exposing myself to view. I only saw one
herd of these haartebeest as big as this one again. I fancy forty
animals in a herd is nothing out of the ordinary, but in the
Western Soudan, from my experience, they are generally in much
smaller herds.</p>

<p>After the incident of the haartebeest we continued our march
towards the lake. The carriers had by this time come up with me,
and were eager to get to the water, as the day was hot and they had
nothing to drink by the way. Accordingly we pushed on at a good
pace, until suddenly a silvery gleam came into view on the horizon,
being evidently the first glimpse of Niangaye. As we approached the
water became more visible. Here we were near the western extremity
of the lake, which extended eastward as far as the eye could reach,
while the breadth must have been about three miles. The shores were
sandy, and the banks covered with dried-up grass and small bushes.
Occasionally a canoe could be seen speeding along under sail,
propelled by a stiff breeze from the north-east. The water was a
fine open expanse; there were a few clumps of reeds at times near
the shores, but these were not dense enough to interfere with
navigation.</p>

<p>The wind referred to blows almost constantly from the same
quarter. It is strongest from about sunrise till 11 a.m., while in
the evening it dies down altogether as a rule. It thus causes a
regular tide, with a difference between high and low water of about
two feet. As the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
lake is shallow, the bed shelving very gently, there is a
considerable difference between the width of the sandy beach
available as a road in the morning and afternoon. The quantity of
water in the lake varies greatly with the season of the year;
indeed, at the end of the dry weather, about May, it is possible to
walk across the lake in several places without so much as wetting
the feet.</p>

<p>Lake Niangaye is one of the largest, if not quite the largest,
of a system of lakes and backwaters of the Niger and its affluents
in the south-west corner of the “Bend” of that river. Lake Niangaye
is the most easterly of this system. The whole of this large area
is known as the “Lake District,” and all round these waters game of
all descriptions abounds. During the season when water is abundant
everywhere the game has no difficulty about drinking; it is
therefore scattered all over this area, and not so easy to locate.
In the dry months, from January to May, however, the case is very
different. Water gets scarcer every month, and the drinking-places
become more and more restricted, so that the game has to
concentrate around the immediate shores of the lakes to get water.
Consequently this is the best time of the year for shooting,
although one disadvantage is that the heat gets very intense, and,
under these conditions, tracking game becomes a very exhausting
pastime. The sandy soil surrounding the lakes for many miles
scorches the feet, while the sun beats mercilessly down upon the
sportsman’s head. Of course, many kinds of animals retire when the
sun gets up in the heavens, about nine o’clock; but this is often
the best time to find such game as Senegal haartebeest and gazelle,
which can be discovered resting from the heat of the day in the
shade of a mimosa tree. These animals are sometimes very shy and
unapproachable in the early morning or evening, and frequently
one’s only chance of a shot at a beast you have been tracking for
some time is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span> during
the middle of the day, when he is not so much on the alert.</p>

<p>The village we entered near the western end of the lake was
called Kanioumé. I was particularly anxious to stop a few hours
here, in order to interview the chief. He was the most influential
man in this region, all the villages on the southern shore of
Niangaye being subservient to him. This man was a Fulah, and as he
had had constant dealings with the Commissioner of the district, on
account of his influential position in the country, I had been
recommended to make arrangements for local hunters, supplies, and
so forth through him. I had been given the names of the best
hunters in the district, and was told that this chief would be able
to furnish me with them.</p>

<p>The chief was most obliging, providing me with everything I
required without delay; but the hunters were not forthcoming. They
were, he said, at Douentza, several days’ march away, and the
head-quarters of the French Resident. Fortunately, I had taken the
precaution, before leaving Saraféré, to write to the Resident of
Douentza, informing him of my intended hunting trip in his country,
and at the same time mentioning that I wished for the services of
these particular hunters. I therefore hoped that they would soon
reach me. This chief informed me, and I subsequently discovered
that his statement was perfectly correct, that there were
practically no native hunters in the region. It appeared that the
Fulanis, who formed almost the entire population of this part of
the Lake District, never themselves hunted, hence the difficulty of
securing a man who knew the haunts of the game in the neighbourhood
was great. It seems strange that these people, living in the midst
of a country inhabited by wild animals, should not care to hunt
them, but so it is. The chief, however, relieved my worst
apprehensions to a certain extent by assuring me that at
Bambara-Maaundé<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
there was one hunter; I therefore bade him send at once to the man
to tell him to be ready to meet me there the next day. At the end
of the palaver I rejoiced the chief’s heart with a present of a
head of tobacco from my now dwindling store of the leaf.</p>

<p>The chief and a cavalcade of his retinue accompanied me as far
as the next village, some six miles further along the lake, where I
was going to spend the night. Having made all arrangements for our
comfort there, he took his departure.</p>

<p>After leaving Kanioumé the lake widens considerably. The
opposite shore cannot be seen until within about three miles of the
eastern extremity. The total length of Niangaye is about
thirty-five miles. Near Bambara-Maaundé the eastern end is divided
into two forks by a high ridge of hills, the width of the neck of
land at the foot of these hills and separating the two forks of
water being about five miles. The southern shore is much more
wooded than the northern shore, but even on the south there are
frequently stretches of sandy country without any vegetation other
than a coarse grass. The northern shore is also covered in many
places with dense reeds, making navigation more difficult. On both
sides of the lake the ground rises rather rapidly, until a plateau,
two to three hundred feet above the level of the water, is reached.
Most of the game is on this plateau on the southern side of
Niangaye, merely coming down daily to drink.</p>

<p>For a few days I made Bambara-Maaundé my head-quarters, leaving
camp early every morning and returning at midday, then going out
again in the afternoon. I found the hunter, who had been ordered to
be ready at the village, awaiting my arrival. So far there was no
news from Douentza of the two hunters I had sent for, so I sent
another urgent runner to the Resident for them. The day after my
arrival I shot a fine Senegal haartebeest, within<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span> two hours of camp, and this
was the occasion when I lost my horse temporarily.</p>

<p>I had ridden out with the hunter, as was my custom, when we got
on to the tracks of a fine solitary bull haartebeest. I dismounted
to follow it on foot, leaving the horse with the hunter and my
second rifle-bearer. I soon perceived him about six hundred yards
away, browsing at the top of a little rise. The ground was very
open and sloped up gradually towards him, so I had to be very
cautious in stalking. Fortune favoured me this time, and I was able
to get within comfortable shot, unperceived. The first bullet
dropped him, mortally wounded through the lungs. My hunter came up
with the horses. These he tied up while we were skinning the
animal, having secured the end of my horse’s bridle to the branch
of a mimosa tree.</p>

<p>We were busily engaged with our hunting knives when I suddenly
looked up and saw my steed, having slipped his head-collar,
trotting quietly down the hill. He gradually increased his pace to
a gallop before we had time to stop him, until he was lost to view.
I sent the rifle-bearer after in pursuit, thinking he would catch
him grazing quietly at the nearest spot, where he could find some
good grass. To cut a long story short, the native lost the horse’s
tracks on some hard, rocky ground, returning about two hours later
with the news. There was nothing for it but to walk back to camp
and send out parties to search for my mount, if he had not
returned, as I hoped, to the village. He was not at the camp,
whither I returned ignominiously on foot, so I told the chief to
send out search parties.</p>

<p>All available horses were collected to mount the tracking party,
and when the men were assembled they were really rather a
picturesque group. The Fulah on horseback looks quite his best, for
these men have a good seat and are good horsemen, but, like most
natives, they are bad horsemasters. There was a collection of some
twenty men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span> armed
with the national weapon, a spear, looking more as if they were
going out to fight than to look for a lost horse.</p>

<p>It was not till long after nightfall that I heard a great stir
outside, and, by the light of a bright moon, I could perceive
mounted figures rapidly approaching across the plain. On they came
at full gallop, brandishing their spears and uttering wild cries,
until they arrived opposite my camp, when they drew rein so
suddenly as to throw their steeds on to their haunches. By the
triumphant cries I guessed the horse had been found, as, indeed, he
had. I think he must have lost himself, as, when they discovered
him, he was lying down, tired out, and apparently only too glad to
be caught and led back to camp.</p>

<p>After a few days’ good sport, but still without news of the
Douentza hunters, I determined to wait no longer, but to start for
the elephant country with my local hunter at once. My so-called
hunter was really not of much use, except as a guide to show me the
road home at the end of the day, for his knowledge of the
whereabouts of game was decidedly limited. He was also hardly an
experienced tracker, but still, in this respect he might have been
worse. In these circumstances I had to go and ascertain the place
where the elephant were now to be found for myself, before I could
decide where to pitch my camp. On one of my shooting trips I had
come across some old spoor, leading down to the lake. I now went to
this place with a view to making it the base of my tracking
operations, intending to work backwards from there, in order to try
to find the feeding-grounds of this herd. All this country is so
thinly populated that for miles there are no habitations, and
therefore I could not expect to get any information from
natives.</p>

<p>That day I camped temporarily close to the place where these old
tracks existed, near the brink of Niangaye. It was here that
fortune smiled upon me for a change. That<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_211">[211]</span> evening, just I was retiring for the night,
I heard a low thundering noise, and noticed the peculiar strong
odour which is found with elephants. I at once came to the
conclusion that they must be coming down to bathe at the lake, and,
moreover, could not be far off. Hastily seizing my rifle and
throwing on some khaki clothes over my light-coloured pyjamas, I
went out of my tent at the same instant that the local hunter came
to tell me the elephant were indeed approaching the lake. It was a
beautiful moonlight night, and the animals sounded so near that I
was afraid they would see the camp and take alarm, so I gave
instructions for everyone to keep perfectly quiet and for the fires
to be put out. It did, indeed, seem a strange thing that they
should almost run into my camp the night I arrived there!</p>

<p>As I cautiously crept through the light bush, making a wide
circuit to avoid giving them my wind, I shall never forget the
splendid sight that broke on my view. In front of me was a herd of
some forty elephants, drinking and bathing in the water of the
lake. A bright moon shed her rays on the scene, making the water
sparkle in a silvery sheen, while thousands of stars twinkled in
the deep blue sky overhead. These splendid creatures appeared to be
thoroughly enjoying themselves, and I waited under cover to feast
my eyes on the sight for a few seconds. I could see them revelling
in the luxury of their bath, douching themselves with water taken
up in their trunks, splashing and disporting themselves in high
frolic.</p>

<p>At this moment how I longed to be able to take a photograph of
this remarkable scene, of which, though it is so vividly pictured
on my memory, I have no other record!</p>

<p>I carefully singled out the best tuskers and waited my
opportunity for a shot. To advance any further would have been
fatal, for I was now on the edge of the scrub,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_212">[212]</span> and between me and the elephant was a
narrow strip of open sandy beach, while they were some thirty yards
further in the water, possibly altogether eighty yards from me.</p>

<p>Having drunk their fill, the great beasts proceeded to retreat
leisurely homewards. Now would be my opportunity for a shot.
Manœuvring to keep the best tuskers in view, I had no difficulty in
shooting down one as he stopped, within twenty yards of me, while
he reached at a branch with his great trunk. I hit him through the
ear in the brain, and he fell on the spot. At the same instant I
saw the other tusker close at hand, and gave him two bullets in
rapid succession. He was hard hit, but did not fall. The whole
occurrence had not taken more than a few seconds, but before I had
time to reload the noise was deafening.</p>

<p>The huge herd, evidently more frightened than enraged, except
perhaps for the wounded elephant, by the report of my rifle and the
fall of their comrade, stampeded. They charged violently forward in
all directions, trampling under foot all that came in their way,
screaming and trumpeting as they went.</p>

<p>Some half-dozen came careering towards me; there was neither
time nor space to evade them, and I must own my life seemed not
worth a minute’s purchase just then. I thought I must inevitably be
crushed to atoms under their massive feet; there seemed no chance
of escape. In the hope of making myself as inconspicuous as
possible, I flung myself flat on the ground, knowing all the time
that though they might not notice me in their impetuous flight,
those gigantic forms could hardly avoid running over my prostrate
body.</p>

<p>By great good fortune something, I cannot for the life of me
think what it was, made them swerve aside, passing within a few
inches of me where I lay. I can hardly<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_213">[213]</span> describe what a tiny, impotent creature one
feels at such a moment. How powerless was I against one of these
animals, should he by chance brush against me! I suppose that is
about the narrowest escape I ever had, and an experience I am not
anxious to repeat.</p>

<p>In an incredibly short space of time the whole herd had
disappeared, the only sign of their recent visit being the clouds
of dust, the trampled soil, and the dead elephant.</p>

<p>While this scene had been going on the hunter, my servant, and
my following had bolted in all directions, alarmed, I suppose, lest
the elephants should rush through the camp. When quiet had been
restored the natives began to return. The excitement had been
rather trying, and there was nothing further to be done that night.
I gave orders for an early start in the morning in pursuit of the
wounded elephant, while the men left in camp were to cut up the
dead animal.</p>

<p>Accompanied by the hunter I started before daylight, following
the tracks which were fairly visible. The wounded animal had kept
company with the rest of the herd, for, within a mile or two of
camp, all the separated tracks of the scattered elephants reunited.
As the day dawned it became clear from the blood that he had been
severely wounded. I thought that the first shot had hit him in the
head, and the second a little below the heart as he turned
broadside to me, but of this I could not be sure. We were able to
follow the tracks at a gentle amble, so distinct were they. After
proceeding thus for about seven miles, we arrived at the top of the
rising ground and on to the plateau, which I have previously
mentioned. The scrub now got thicker, but there was no difficulty
in riding anywhere. Proceeding another five miles or so, we
suddenly came across the wounded elephant standing under a small
tree, sheltering from the sun, for it was getting hot and was now
nine o’clock. There had been<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_214">[214]</span> nothing to indicate that his footsteps were
lagging. However, he must have got tired and been unable to keep up
with the rest of the herd any longer.</p>

<p>The hunter was carrying my big rifle at this time, while I had
the ·303 slung at my saddle. Seizing the ·450 from him I rapidly
dismounted, while all this time the elephant appeared not to have
noticed us, having its back turned in our direction. I skirted
through the bush in order to get a shot at its brain, the animal
being, I suppose, not more than thirty yards away. As I faced it it
suddenly perceived me and lifted up its trunk as if to charge; I
was then not twenty yards off. I fired under its uplifted trunk,
when it swerved aside, the blood streaming from its mouth. A second
shot penetrated its brain, and it fell to the ground quite
dead.</p>

<p>The tusks of this elephant weighed fifty-two pounds each, while
the other had ivory weighing just over forty-five pounds on either
side. The ivory was not big, but I was given to understand that,
for that country, the tusks were very fair, and that it was rare to
get tusks weighing even sixty pounds; so under the circumstances I
was fortunate.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that the elephant of this region do not
carry big ivory, although possibly the explanation is a simple one.
There are no big trees in the country, which is an extraordinarily
open one for elephant, consisting of sandy soil, light scrub and,
in places, mimosa or other trees never more than thirty or forty
feet high. Such is the district in which these animals are here
found; besides, water is scarce. Away from the lake there is no
water of any description for nearly forty miles.</p>

<p>Having found the line of retreat of the elephant, and knowing
that it lay through a waterless tract of country, I decided to
provision myself with water next day and attempt to come up with
the herd again. Accordingly, the following morning very early,
equipped with three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
days’ water supply, I set out in pursuit of the herd. It seemed
evident that they must have a permanent feeding-ground, which could
supply them with better provender than was obtainable in the
country I had seen, and the chances were that if I could discover
this feeding-ground I should also find the elephant. The tracks
were plainly discernible nearly the whole way; only once did we
lose them for a short time on some stony ground. Proceeding for
about six miles beyond the place where I had found the wounded
elephant, I noticed the country becoming much more wooded. We were
now about eighteen miles from Lake Niangaye. Here the tracks of the
elephant branched off in various directions, and it was without
doubt their feeding-ground.</p>

<p>Picking up the biggest tracks we could see, we followed these
for some distance through this wooded region. The ground here was
quite rocky in many places, the sandy soil having disappeared. I
had noticed that the ivory of my tusks was chipped, and it seemed
that this must be the solution. Probably these elephant broke their
tusks on the hard, rocky surface of their feeding-place. This
wooded country appeared to extend for a considerable distance in a
southerly direction.</p>

<p>Still following the tracks of this animal, which led to a place
where he had evidently slept the previous night, we suddenly
crossed some perfectly fresh tracks of another elephant. It was
some hours later, when following this elephant, which I had
wounded, that I came across a strange tribe of people who dwell in
caves. The elephant’s tracks had led me to the foot of the Hombori
Mountains, and it is here that these people live. They wear
practically no clothing, and are very timid. Probably they had
hardly seen a white man in those parts before. They are called the
Habbés. They live chiefly by hunting round the shores of a lake
called Kurorua, lying at the foot of the hills.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span> I could not understand their
language, and being short of provisions I had to curtail my stay in
their country. This place is about forty miles from Lake Niangaye,
and it seemed that the elephant used to drink at one or other of
these lakes, according to circumstances, their feeding-ground being
nearly half-way between the two.</p>

<p>The Habbés use bows and arrows, but also have old-fashioned
guns, for which they manufacture their own powder out of saltpetre,
found locally. Their bullets are more often made of small, sharp
stones than of lead, but any rough missile will serve them.</p>

<p>Between the feeding-ground, which I discovered was called
Tinsida, and Lake Kurorua, the country again becomes sandy and
sparsely covered with vegetation. In all this sandy country the
violent wind from the north-east, which I had experienced at
Niangaye, blows. This wind raises sandstorms, which are not only
most disagreeable, but are also very bad for the mechanism of a
rifle should it be at all complicated. However careful one may be
it is exceedingly difficult to avoid getting sand into the breech,
with the result that a jam may occur. This actually happened to me
at a very awkward moment, when hunting elephant. I had to abandon
my ·450 and fire with my ·303. Fortunately for me the animal did
not charge home, or I should probably have had some difficulty in
stopping him with the light bullet of the small rifle. This was not
the only occasion when I had a bad jam on account of the sand, and,
later on, when crossing the Sahara, I found matters still worse, as
the sandstorms were more frequent and more violent.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the 3rd of April I returned to
Bambara-Maaundé on my way north to Timbuctu. My first plan had been
to march due north, but I could get no guide to show me the way.
The Fulanis declared that the route was impracticable at this time
of year, owing to the scarcity of water, and in any case they had
no man to serve as guide who knew the route.</p>

<p>I had grave suspicions of the truth of their statements, but
unfortunately was not in a position to prove they were lying. In
the end I had to go the way they recommended as being the only one
possible at the time of the year. This route entailed a two days’
march, followed by three days by canoe.</p>

<p>Carriers were not to be had as the Fulani is much too proud, or
too lazy, to carry a load. So I had to hire bullocks for my
baggage. Bullocks and camels, when obtainable, do all the transport
in these regions. Bullocks can, at a pinch, march two days without
water, carrying a load of about 150 lbs. They are humped oxen, very
slow and sure in their movements. The driver—there is one to each
animal—sits on the front of the hump, with the loads behind him,
guiding his beast with a kind of rein passing through its
nostrils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
</p>

<p>At first we passed along the shores of Lake Niangaye, meeting on
the way some camel and bullock caravans coming into the village.
For the place is on the route from the north to Douentza market,
and a fair amount of trade travels this way. A curious feature of
this end of the lake is the number of pelicans seen on the water.
They all congregate on the opposite side to Bambara-Maaundé,
appearing to breed there in some quantities. In the evening the
birds collect together, uttering strange cries, reminding one
rather of the wildfowl on the seashores in the wilder parts of the
British coast. They are uncouth-looking creatures with their
enormous beaks, but seem to thrive wonderfully well on the fish of
the lake. I suppose when the water here dries up they migrate to
the Niger and its tributaries. I shot a few geese at Niangaye, but
duck and teal were very scarce. The surrounding country is well
stocked with sand-grouse and lesser bustard, but other varieties of
game birds are not plentiful. I think I saw only one bushfowl, and
the few guinea-fowl I shot appeared to be very tough. Indeed, I
always noticed that the guinea-fowl shot in sandy districts was
tough, irrespective of the age of the bird. I often wondered if
possibly this was due to the semi-desert diet which they have to
live on here.</p>

<p>We had to cross the high ridge of ground which separated the two
easterly forks of the lake previously mentioned, and, when finally
quitting the farthest fork of water, our journey took us through a
patch of desert land. It was in this desert patch that I saw
several ostriches. The huge birds were on the sky-line about half a
mile away when I first noticed them, and, strangely enough, did not
appear to have perceived me; for they moved in quite a leisurely
manner out of sight, instead of striding off as they usually do
when alarmed.</p>

<p>I decided to try to stalk them. Provided they did
not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span> move too
rapidly the chances seemed to be in my favour, for the slope of the
ground was such that I should be able to advance almost to the top
of the ridge in front of me, unperceived. The wind helped me, as it
was blowing directly in my face, so I was able successfully to
carry out my plan, and, on arriving at the summit of the ridge, I
got a fairly easy shot, lying behind a small hillock, at one of the
birds. The feathers were not in bad condition, and later I found
some of them invaluable for bartering with Arabs. Judging by the
tracks, there appeared to be a number of these birds between the
Niger and Lake Niangaye, although most of the ostrich hunting is
done on the other side of the Niger and some hundred miles lower
down. By questioning my native followers, indeed, I found that
these ostriches do not seem to be hunted at all.</p>

<p>That day we did a long march, as I was anxious to get across the
desert and camp by the water on the far side that night. The water
was a swampy stream, called Tango-Maré, which was one of the
tributaries of the River Bara-Issa. I camped by its shores, where
the sand-flies and mosquitoes were worse than I had experienced for
a very long time. My servant and the police orderly both got a
severe attack of fever in consequence, and I passed a most
uncomfortable night.</p>

<p>There was an encampment of wandering Tuaregs close by who made
things look brighter by a very acceptable present of camel’s milk,
accompanied by protestations of friendship. This gift and the
message accompanying it seemed so unlike the usual custom of the
Tuaregs, where Europeans were concerned, that I made inquiries on
the subject. It transpired that the last visit they had had from
white men was when the French troops had visited this particular
tribe and punished them severely for some misdeed. They evidently
had a wholesome respect for the European now, or they would hardly
have taken the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
trouble to offer presents to a single individual! After leaving the
stream where I had spent the night, we emerged on a country
intersected by small lakes, swamps and marshy streams. I had sent
on my baggage and servant early, staying myself behind to enjoy
some duck shooting close to my camp of the previous night. The
guide who was with me professed to know the route our loads had
followed, but I hardly wonder he was at fault on several
occasions.</p>

<p>Sometimes this network of waterways became practically one wide
sheet of water, so intimately connected were the swamps and
streams. On arriving at a place of this description, it became a
matter of great difficulty to know where the water was fordable.
The only plan was to try at a likely-looking spot, and go on until
the water became too deep, when a new direction must be struck. It
would have been dangerous to attempt to swim, owing to the thickly
packed reeds which grew in profusion everywhere. Many times, after
proceeding about half-way, and congratulating myself that we had
found a passage, a hole or dense reeds prevented further progress,
and we had to beat a retreat, endeavouring to find another ford. By
the time we finally got to the other side of these huge morasses it
was getting late, but fortunately the track was now dry and fairly
well defined, so we were able to move at a good pace. I fully
expected to hear, when joining the baggage, that half of it had
been lost in the water, so it was cheering to be told that, beyond
a little wetting, not much harm had been done. The guide with the
baggage party appeared to have found a better crossing than we had
done.</p>

<p>I had now reached a place from which I could get a navigable way
to Kabara, as the port of Timbuctu is called. The name of this
village was Sariamou, and it was on one of the main tributaries of
the Bara-Issa.</p>

<p>After negotiating with the chief native trader of the place, I
arranged for a canoe, with an awning of palm-thatch,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span> to be ready for me the
following day. I had a crew of five men, so that I should be able
to travel fast. I estimated my distance from Kabara at seventy
miles as the crow flies, so it was probably quite eighty by water,
a distance I could not hope to cover in less than three days.
Moreover, I could not arrange for the canoemen to accompany me more
than one day, so that there were certain to be further vexatious
delays in getting relief crews. In one respect I was lucky,
however, that I should be able to keep the same canoe the whole
way; besides, this canoe was a fairly comfortable one as they went,
and should I have been obliged to change daily, I should have had
to put up with very inferior craft.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw3" id="i22"><img src="images/i22.jpg" alt=

<div>
<p class="sc">Timbuctu</p>

<p class="justify">The trees are in the cemetery. A monument is put
up here to Lieut. Aube and his party who were killed in a battle
with the Tuareg at this spot in 1894 when trying to penetrate the
mysterious city of Timbuctu.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>I occupied the centre of the canoe, while my servant and baggage
were at one end and the crew at the other. There was just room to
put up a camp table under my awning, where I could read or write,
and at sunset we used to halt at the nearest village, so as to get
a night’s rest ashore.</p>

<p>The route was rather intricate, as the main stream was
frequently blocked by impenetrable “borgou,” necessitating a
diversion through some side creek, and thereby lengthening our
journey considerably. I found out also that very often the natives
only knew the way from one village to the next, so that a guide had
to be taken at almost each village we passed. These villages were
inhabited by the Sonrhais, who were possessors of big herds of
cattle similar to those owned by the Fulanis on the Niger. There
was also in each village a certain proportion of Bosos, who were
the fisherfolk of this country. The swampy banks were the haunts of
numerous wart-hog, and one could often get a shot at these animals
from the canoe as they stopped to watch it in their stupid fashion
before scuttling off into the bush. Kob were also plentiful about
these marshy streams, as were their near relatives, the Bohor
reed-buck. For almost every kind of West<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_222">[222]</span> African game which frequents marshy tracts
this was a splendid shooting country. The natives themselves hunt
little, so that the game is not so shy and scared as it often is in
places thickly populated with these hunters. The Sonrhais are too
much given up to cattle and horse raising, while the Bosos are
quite as devoted to their fishing, for either tribe to care for
hunting game.</p>

<p>The horses in this locality were some of the finest I had seen.
These people make rather a speciality, for natives, of
horse-breeding. When the land is inundated and pasturage is rich,
the horses are left for several months at a time in the fallow
ground at the water-side. I noticed large droves of horses as we
passed the banks. There were a large number of mares with foals on
the higher ground, while the stallions were usually nearer the
water.</p>

<p>I had despatched my horse by a more circuitous land route, so he
would be several days later than I in arriving at Timbuctu, if,
indeed, he ever arrived. He had been consigned to the care of the
headman of the village, and was to be passed on from one to the
other <i>en route</i>. In any case, the little beast had done me
good service, and I had certainly had a good three pounds’ worth of
value from him!</p>

<p>On the 7th of April we entered the Niger, at a point some miles
below the junction of its two branches, Issa-Ber and Bara-Issa. A
short while after stopping for breakfast that morning we passed a
barge, flying the French colours. The occupants were the officer in
charge of the ostrich farm at Niafounké and his wife. They had been
down the river for nearly three hundred miles to decide on a more
suitable site for the farm, and were now on their way back to
Niafounké. The lady was certainly the only European representative
of her sex on that side of Koulikoro, and was regarded with great
astonishment by many of the natives, who naturally had never seen a
white woman before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
</p>

<p>Soon after midday we sighted a small building on the river
banks, built at the point where a big backwater of the Niger quits
the main stream. This was Korioumé, and is used as the port of
Timbuctu instead of Kabara during the driest months of the year, as
vessels are then unable to get nearer to Timbuctu, owing to the
lack of water. Kabara lies about five and a half miles further on,
being approached by a canal. This canal is being enlarged to allow
the passage of larger craft than can use it at present.</p>

<p>Kabara consists of a collection of mud huts, forming the
dwellings of the transport officials and the native population.
Alongside the quay lie a variety of river craft, barges, and steel
as well as wooden canoes. It is not an imposing-looking spot, but
is important as the head-quarters of the Navigation Service for the
section Kabara to Ansongo, a distance of nearly four hundred
miles.</p>

<p>I landed and presented myself at the Transport Office, where I
was provided with donkeys to carry my kit to Timbuctu, and was
informed that the Commandant had very thoughtfully sent a horse for
me to ride up to the town. All baggage is conveyed by donkeys to
Timbuctu, and there are a number of men in the town who make their
living by letting out donkeys for this purpose. The country
immediately assumes the appearance of a desert on leaving Kabara.
There is a wide track, worn by thousands of animals’ feet, leading
through the soft sand across the five miles which separate Timbuctu
from her port. Beyond a few scattered gum trees, mimosa, and a
little coarse grass, there is nothing but sand on all sides.</p>

<p>A short distance to the right of the road in the desert, and
about half-way to Timbuctu, is a monument erected to Commandant
Obb, the first Frenchman to try to enter Timbuctu. He had only a
small following of twenty, and perished with all his gallant men in
the attempt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span> The
monument is placed at the spot where he fell. The town was at that
time in the hands of the Tuaregs, who swarmed in hundreds round his
small band until they had annihilated it. Several subsequent
attempts were made to capture the town before they finally
succeeded. Curiously enough, the capture of Timbuctu was eventually
made by a mere handful of men under a French naval lieutenant, and
was effected by surprise. Since then, although it has several times
been threatened by raiding bands of Tuaregs, it has never been out
of the possession of the French.</p>

<p>On ascending a slight rise in the road, Timbuctu, the Mysterious
City, suddenly comes into view.</p>

<p>As I saw it the scene spread out before me was a strange one. In
a slight depression was the town itself, a conglomeration of sandy,
brown buildings, with flat roofs, while here and there a minaret
obtruded its pointed head. Most prominent of all were three
mosques, one at the east, another at the centre, and the third at
the west of the town. At the extreme western corner were three
solitary palm trees, behind which the sun was dying, and as its
last rays caught the sombre-hued houses they were lit up and stood
out more clearly from the surrounding desert which they so closely
resembled.</p>

<p>There was something rather fascinating about this quaint desert
city, so solemn and subdued did it appear to be. But on the whole
my feelings were those of disappointment, for I had expected a far
more imposing-looking place. I had pictured to myself a town of
fine Moorish buildings, minaretted palaces, and the bright
appearance of an Oriental city. It had seemed to me that the
influence of the Moorish occupation must be strongly impressed on
Timbuctu, but this is not so to any marked extent. In point of
fact, except for the three mosques, the general appearance of the
town was very much like many others I had seen<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_225">[225]</span> on my journey through Western
Soudan—anyhow, in the distance. Timbuctu’s chief difference lies
rather in her surroundings than in her individuality. She is alone
in the desert. The desert surrounds her on all sides. The Niger is
no longer a feature of the scenery; all her water is obtained from
wells. As a matter of fact, sometimes, when the floods have been
heavier than usual, a small backwater occasionally runs up from
Kabara to Timbuctu, but this soon disappears as the floods subside,
and to see water above ground is a rare sight.</p>

<p class="justify">These natives are Sonrhais who have brought milk

for sale.</p>

<p>Some of the wells are very deep, going down as much as seventy
metres. The water is very good, however, and is seldom filtered.
After presenting myself to the Commandant I was shown to the house
of the military officer administering the district where I was to
stay. My host, Captain Ferrière, was most thoughtful and obliging
during my sojourn at Timbuctu, and I look back with pleasure to the
pleasant days I spent with him.</p>

<p>I was much disappointed to hear that there was no possibility of
being able to cross the Sahara from Timbuctu direct, as I had
arranged. It appeared that, owing to some raiding bands of Southern
Morocco having descended recently through the very country by which
I wanted to pass, the guides were afraid to go that way. In
addition the heat had this year been more severe than usual, and
many wells were dry. At one stage it was necessary to march ten
days without water. This being the case, I had to abandon all idea
of starting the desert journey from Timbuctu, as I had intended,
for to cross the Sahara without a guide is an absolute
impossibility.</p>

<p>There was an alternative route open to me, however; this
debouched from Gao, a place 270 miles further down the Niger, and
was considerably to the east of the route I had proposed to take
from Timbuctu. In addition to the annoyance of having to alter my
plans, I was now somewhat<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_226">[226]</span> what anxious whether I should be able to
arrive in England by the date my leave expired, for my journey
would now be lengthened by some 700 miles altogether. I was further
delayed a few days at Timbuctu before transport could be arranged
for me to go down the river to Gao. I was told that I could have a
steel canoe or a barge, but the former was much faster although not
so comfortable. Before deciding it was suggested that I should take
an experimental trip in the steel canoe, as the motion in these
craft is rather pronounced and has the effect of making some people
sea-sick!</p>

<p>On Sunday morning two French officers and I, having arranged a
shooting picnic on the river, embarked on the steel canoe. This
particular canoe was built expressly light to carry mails rapidly
between Kabara and the down-river ports. She was rather narrow in
the beam, and travelled at a great pace when propelled by her six
paddlers. For the first half-hour I did not feel much
inconvenience, but after this the violent rocking motion made me
feel very uncomfortable; besides, owing to the constant shaking,
reading or writing was out of the question. Finally, I must
acknowledge that, on the return journey, I succumbed, and, indeed,
so bad was I that I had a violent attack of fever before I got
ashore. On landing, the transport officer at Kabara very kindly
gave me a bed in his house, with plenty of blankets and quinine, so
that by the next day I was much better. But this experience with
the steel canoe decided me against that particular form of
conveyance, and, at the risk of taking a few days longer on the
journey, I gave an unhesitating vote for the barge!</p>

<p>During my enforced stay at Timbuctu I had ample leisure to
explore the sights of the place. I was introduced to an interesting
Frenchman, who is popularly known to his friends and the natives as
Yakubu. Yakubu had the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_227">[227]</span> reputation, which he thoroughly deserved,
of knowing more about Timbuctu than any man. He had previously been
a Roman Catholic Father in the town, but some years ago had given
up mission work for private life. He now taught native children
purely from a love of teaching. Besides his knowledge of Timbuctu,
he had an intimate acquaintance with Bambaras and Sonrhais and
their languages, which he spoke fluently. It was with “Père” Yakubu
that I made my tour of exploration in the city.</p>

<p>Timbuctu and the exploration of Africa during last century are
very intimately connected. Most of the principal explorers of that
time paid a visit to this historic city. This was perhaps all the
more natural as, at that period, the course of the Niger was a
problem which puzzled everyone, and many of these travellers had in
view the exploration of that river. At Timbuctu are to be seen the
houses of most of these explorers, which have been identified by
the French since their occupation and kept by them in a good state
of repair.</p>

<p>Starting with the earliest date comes the house of a
fellow-countryman, Major Laing. This British officer made an
adventurous journey in 1826 from Morocco to Timbuctu, through the
Sahara Desert, and through a land peopled with lawless fanatical
Mohammedans. He accomplished the journey there without mishap, but
on his return by the same route he was waylaid and killed in the
desert, north of Timbuctu. He is said to have been killed by the
Kountah Arabs, who inhabit a portion of the Sahara north of the
town; but it is a point difficult to prove. Some people say that
the present chief of the Kountahs has actually in his possession
Laing’s diary and papers, which were never recovered,<a id=
"FNanchor_01"></a><a href="#Footnote_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
but that he is now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
afraid of restoring them to the French for fear of punishment. If
this is the case it must have been the present chief’s grandfather
who was responsible for the deed. The next traveller to pass that
way was Réné Caillé, a Frenchman, and, I suppose, the most renowned
French explorer of Africa. He did a wonderful journey in 1828 from
Konakry, in French Guinea, to Morocco. He travelled down the Niger
for many hundred miles on his way to Timbuctu.</p>

<p>After him came the very great African traveller, Barth, whose
house is in better preservation than any other. He was the man who
travelled from Tripoli, through our British protectorate of
Northern Nigeria, to Timbuctu and back, in 1853. Barth spent a
considerable time at Timbuctu, disguised as an Arab trader and
known by the name of Abdul Karim. He had several narrow escapes,
but came successfully out of all his adventures.</p>

<p>The next house to be seen is that of Lenz, an Austrian, who
journeyed from Morocco to Dakar in 1880.</p>

<p>The interior of these houses, as of nearly all the houses in the
town, is of Moorish design. There are generally an inner and an
outer courtyard, on a very small scale. Most of the houses have two
storeys, and all are built of sun-dried bricks, made of the clay
which is found under the sand in the desert. The streets are narrow
and tortuous. They twist and wind in such a curious manner that a
guide is necessary for some time before it is possible to find
one’s own way in the place. At one or two points great clay ovens
are to be seen in the street; these are public property, and here
the local bread is baked. It is a curious sight to watch a crowd of
people round an oven in the daytime, each one putting in his or her
loaf to be baked. This bread is made of a wheat grown at Gundam,
near Timbuctu, and is black. The wheat is, I believe, the same as
is grown in many parts of North Africa, making a very<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span> wholesome and nourishing food,
which is the staple diet of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The history of the mosques brings me to discuss the origin of
the greatness of Timbuctu.</p>

<p>Timbuctu was originally the capital of a great black empire. The
inhabitants were Sonrhais, whose territory extended practically all
over the Middle Niger. The Sonrhay kings were men of great
influence, and the town was the centre of a large trade. For many
years Moors from the north and the black races from the south,
east, and west used to bring their wares to its markets. The
Sonrhay Empire was far the most powerful in Western Africa,
continuing to be so till the Moorish invasion in 1482. The Moors
defeated the Sonrhais, driving them to take refuge on the other
bank of the Niger, in the “Bend.” They were in turn driven out of
the town by the Tuaregs about the seventeenth century, and the
Tuaregs remained in possession until the French finally captured
the town at the end of last century.</p>

<p>Timbuctu was the centre of the traffic in slaves in this part of
Africa, and there is no doubt that at that time it was a far larger
place than it now is. The remains of old houses are frequently
discovered under the sand at some distance from the existing
boundaries of the city, while it seems very probable that the Niger
once flowed past its walls.</p>

<p>The Sonrhais certainly extended in olden times from Djenné, in
the south, to Es-Souk, in the north. The latter place is now right
in the Sahara, about the 21st parallel north latitude. But now this
once powerful race has greatly degenerated. Since their conquest by
the Moors, and then by the Tuaregs, they have been in perpetual
slavery; thus their spirit appears to have become quite crushed,
and the race has been split up into little groups. We have met them
in fractions all over the “Bend” of the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_230">[230]</span> Niger, and they are again to be found in
small parties lower down that river. They have intermarried a good
deal with their last conquerors, the Tuaregs, whom they frequently
resemble in features. The negroid type of the pure Sonrhay has in
many cases almost disappeared, while they have become paler in
complexion, although they are still much blacker than the
Tuaregs.</p>

<p>The mosques date from the eleventh century, and have curious
pyramidical minarets. During the sixteenth century they had arches
of Moorish design added to them by the Moorish chief Mali, who then
occupied the town. Here the remarkable influence of the desert sand
is noticeable, for, to get to the arches which are inside the
mosques, a descent of three or four feet from the level of the
street outside has to be made. This shows that sand to the
thickness of several feet has gradually become heaped on to the
ground outside, thereby heightening the level of the surface.</p>

<p>The chief trade of the city is salt. This is brought by large
caravans periodically from the desert mines of Taudény, 300 miles
north of the place. The salt is cut in rectangular bars, or flat
slabs, weighing each about sixty pounds. When the caravans arrive,
from November till March, the price of salt is down to five francs
a bar, but it rises rapidly as the hot weather goes on, so that by
the month of August a bar of salt will often cost twenty-five
francs. These salt caravans are frequently attacked by desert
highwaymen. Desert bands have been known to travel immense
distances in order to attack one of them. Frequently they make a
descent from South-west Morocco, over 800 miles of the Sahara, with
the object of looting the camels of the “Azalai,” as the big
caravan of November is called.</p>

<p>At Timbuctu one experiences the true Saharan sirocco, a violent
wind blowing from the north-east. This wind is<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_231">[231]</span> said to originate in the sand-hills,
called the “Great Erg,” south-west of Tunisia. It blows straight
across the desert for over 1800 miles, driving clouds of sand in
front of it. There is nothing to obstruct its progress, for no
mountains of any consequence lie across its path. Hence this wind
appears to be gradually pushing the Sahara further south in the
vicinity of Timbuctu. It has probably been the means of isolating
the town from the Niger, for it has caused the desert to encroach
on the left bank of the river converting the land here into a sandy
waste. The sand I had experienced hitherto was nothing compared to
the sand at Timbuctu. The streets are several inches deep in soft
sand, it is nearly always blowing gales of sand; and as a result of
all this every corner of a house and all one’s possessions are
invaded by sand. But on account of this dry atmosphere Timbuctu is
a very healthy place; sickness of any sort is uncommon, and the
natives are said to be remarkable for their longevity.</p>

<p>The only domestic animals seen in the town are camels, horses,
and donkeys. There are no cows, sheep, or even goats, for the
simple reason that there is nothing for these animals to eat.
Camels never stay long at Timbuctu, but are sent out to pasturage
some distance away, where there is more desert vegetation. Donkeys
seem to live on what they can pick up at Kabara, where they go most
days to carry loads. Horses are fed on imported forage.</p>

<p>Camels, of course, come in hundreds to Timbuctu, as they form
the bulk of the animal transport for desert caravans. It is a
strange sight to watch these hardy desert people, trudging in with
their camels from the vast unknown waste, their faces half hidden
in cloths to keep out the ever-blowing sand, looking weary and worn
after the hardships they have had to endure on the way. Lack of
water and want of food, besides the anxieties of keeping the right
direction, tell on these men, imprinting on their<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span> faces a stern, careworn look.
The camels are generally the property of Arabs, either the Kountah
tribe, who are the nearest to Timbuctu, or the Berabeesh, who
wander farther to the north in the desert. The best animals belong
to the latter tribe, possibly because they are farther from the
river, and the Niger water does not agree with these animals.
Moreover, camels which live near the river naturally get into the
habit of drinking more frequently than otherwise, thus losing to a
large extent their powers of existing many days without water.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="chap_sum">Preparing to cross the desert — Articles for
barter — My barge — My new “boy” — My crew — Stranded — A miserable
people — “Cram-cram” — Borgou — Bamba — Under sail — A variety of
game — The defile of Tosaye — The “Oued Telemsi” — A curious
coloured clay — Gao — A lazy class — Mosques at Gao — A perilous
journey — Giraffe.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the 12th of April my barge was to be ready
for me at Kabara. I had asked the Commandant to send a telegram to
the authorities at Gao, advising them of the probable date of my
arrival there, and asking that the necessary camels and guide
should be ready for me. I thus hoped to avoid further delay, as
time was of such importance to me.</p>

<p>While at Timbuctu I had gleaned some information about the
probable line of wells I should follow from Gao, for I had not
previously studied this part of the Sahara, but only that portion I
had intended to cross from Timbuctu in accordance with my original
plans. The information at Timbuctu even was very scanty, and I was
told that before arriving at Gao it would not be possible to find
out any more.</p>

<p>Before leaving Timbuctu I arranged for the despatch of the heads
and skins I had collected since leaving Bamako. They were consigned
to a French firm, who agreed to have them sent through their head
establishment in France to my home address. They would, of course,
go up the Niger and down the Senegal River to the coast. On
arriving at Bamako I had similarly arranged for the despatch of the
trophies I had collected on my way from<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_234">[234]</span> Sierra Leone. As the Senegal River would be
at its driest during the next three or four months, it was probable
that my things would not arrive in England for several months.</p>

<p>Another important matter was to cash my drafts at Timbuctu
before leaving, and to lay in a supply of the most useful articles
for barter <i>en route</i>. Below Timbuctu very little money is
used on the Niger. Salt and a blue cotton stuff are in great
requisition for the purchase of anything. The cotton stuff is
called “guinée” by the French. If it is required to buy a fowl or
sheep the procedure is to break off a piece of salt from one of the
big bars or to tear off a small portion of the “guinée” and give
that in exchange for the article to be purchased. The “guinée” is
measured in “coudées,” or forearm lengths. Between Gao and Timbuctu
a sheep can be bought for two or three “coudées,” but as one gets
farther from the river, on entering the desert, the price of
everything naturally rises rapidly, while in many places even
untold “guinée coudées” will not tempt the native to part with his
produce.</p>

<p>I therefore converted a portion of my cash into salt and
“guinée.” I was also advised to get in a stock of a certain kind of
food which is very useful in the desert and not obtainable at Gao.
This is called “couscous.” It consists merely of the wheat used for
Timbuctu bread, prepared in a particular way. The wheat is unhusked
and then steamed for some hours. It is dry and very portable, at
the same time it softens quickly in a little water, and is easily
digested. “Couscous” can be carried in a bag slung across a camel,
and will keep for months in this manner. Frequently there is not
time to stop for a meal in the desert, when a handful of “couscous”
can be conveniently moistened in a tumbler of water without
dismounting from the camel. I took a large quantity<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span> with me and found it
invaluable. It lasted me all the way across the Sahara.</p>

<p>My barge was about sixty feet long, with a well-covered portion,
about thirty feet long, in the centre, in which I lived. The rest
of the space was for the crew and my servant. I had my bed pitched
in one end of my room, my baggage being arranged all around it,
while the table was in the centre. There was plenty of room, and it
was not uncomfortable. The covering was made of strong palm-thatch,
and was high enough to give plenty of space for a man to stand
upright in the room underneath.</p>

<p>The barge was worked by a crew of eight and a boatswain. They
generally used poles, but sometimes paddled the craft.</p>

<p>In the early morning, until the sun got too hot, I used to sit
on the top of my awning with my shot-gun and rifle beside me, often
getting a shot at a bird or crocodile. It was very pleasant in the
fresh morning air, watching the changing scenery as we glided
steadily past the banks. In the middle of the day I used to halt,
near a village if possible, for lunch. This plan gave the crew a
rest, and was welcomed by everyone as a chance of getting ashore.
In the evening I also used to halt for dinner, but it was then
often dark before we got ashore.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when the banks were favourable, we would tie a rope
on to the mast and tow the barge, while the boatswain sat at the
rudder, shouting out directions to the men on the tow-line. During
the heat of the day, when sitting in my room, I found ample time
for, and occupation in writing up my notes, which had not had as
careful attention as I could have wished while I was hunting in the
“Bend” of the Niger. I cannot say that I ever found the time
hanging heavily on my hands, although, of course, there were
moments when I should have been very glad of a companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
</p>

<p>At Timbuctu I had not been sorry to part with my servant Mamadu,
and had got a far better “boy” in his place. My new factotum was
called Musa. He was a Hausa from the Zaberma country, north-west of
Northern Nigeria, who had for a time been employed by a French
officer at Timbuctu, but was now out of work. Besides being a
better and more trustworthy servant, he had some experience of the
desert. He had been for two years the “boy” of Commandant Gadel, a
distinguished French officer, who had travelled considerably in the
Eastern Sahara. Musa was a hard-working and devoted “boy.” He had
some fairly rough times while in the desert with me, and bore all
the hardships and discomforts uncomplainingly. He was a fine type
of native, standing a little over six feet, with a broad chest and
sturdy arms, and, like most Hausas, was an excellent marcher, a
most indispensable asset for my servant.</p>

<p>My crew were Bambaras, who are preferred by the French as
boatmen on their Niger craft. They are very strong, and wonderfully
enduring. My crew worked day and night for seven days continuously.
By day the whole crew were on duty, while at night they worked in
two reliefs, one half resting and the other half working. We seldom
halted for more than three hours per diem—an hour at midday and two
hours in the evening—so that they really had very little rest.</p>

<p>The Bambaras hold the Sonrhais in great contempt, forgetful of
the day when the Sonrhay was a far more powerful individual than
was the Bambara, and, indeed, held many of that race in slavery.
But times had changed, and it was amusing to hear the scathing
remarks of my boatswain as we passed a Sonrhay canoe or habitation.
He used to say they were a miserable people, more like sheep than
men, because they ate grass growing on the Niger banks! The
Bambaras are rather proud and great<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_237">[237]</span> spendthrifts. They like to live on the fat
of the land, considering a man who is content with humbler diet as
a miserable creature, not even worthy of pity.</p>

<p>The first few miles of the journey after leaving Kabara lay
through a shallow stream, which was the waterway connecting Kabara
with the Niger on the east. This stream was so shallow that we had
considerable difficulty in moving at all. The barge only drew about
nine inches of water, but in spite of this she kept on sticking on
the mud. When this happened the crew had to get out and push until
we got clear. Progress was very slow. Finally, about half a mile
before reaching the Niger, there was practically no water at all.
Our efforts to move the barge were fruitless, and unless we got
help we seemed likely to stick for months, until the water rose.
Accordingly, I sent some of the crew to seek out the nearest
village and bring assistance. It took some fifty men to get us out
of our difficulties, and then it was only effected by digging a
trench under the barge, through which she was hauled by the
triumphant, yelling mob of natives.</p>

<p>Owing to the delay caused by the shallow water our progress that
day was not great. In twelve hours we had only covered eight miles.
But during the remainder of the voyage we averaged thirty-five
miles in the twenty-four hours. As this included a halt of about
three hours daily, and only half the crew were at work during the
night, the result was not bad.</p>

<p>The whole way down the river from Kabara to Gao the banks are
populated by Sonrhais. I must own to rather agreeing with my friend
the Bambara boatswain. These people are certainly very wretched
specimens of humanity. The Sonrhais on this portion of the Niger
seem to have degenerated more than those whom I had hitherto met.
They are absolutely poverty-stricken, and apparently make no effort
to ameliorate their position.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_238">[238]</span> They possess practically no cattle or
sheep, but live on rotting fish and grass. The former is in great
evidence all down the Niger. There are tanks where the fish are
caught, and drying-places close by. In the latter the fish are left
to rot, when they are taken away and eaten. The stench from these
places is truly disgusting. Even the Bambaras used to turn up their
noses at it.</p>

<p>The grass they eat is of two kinds—the “borgou,” with which I
was now so familiar, and which is eaten raw or in a kind of soup,
and “cram-cram.” “Cram-cram” is a grass peculiar to desert
vegetation; it is intensely prickly, and it is the seed of this
that is boiled and eaten by the Sonrhais of this locality.
“Cram-cram” is a very nourishing seed, I was given to understand.
The flocks of the desert are very partial to this grass, as are
also camels. It has the annoying habit of sticking to one’s legs as
one walks through it, just as burrs do in England. “Cram-cram” is
worse, however, than a burr, because it breaks up into countless
little prickles, each one so fine that it can hardly be seen. These
prickles have points as sharp as a needle, which stick into the
fingers of the hapless victim, and are hard to extract because they
are so hard to locate. I once saw a French officer who had a little
dog which was suffering from “cram-cram.” The poor little creature
was in tortures, and unable to withdraw these miniature daggers
from his toes. It took some time and patience on our part before we
could relieve him of all of them.</p>

<p>In some places we would pass a temporary village of Fulanis, who
had come down to the water-side to allow their cattle to graze on
the luxuriant “borgou.” Occasionally, also, we would see an
encampment of Tuaregs, who had selected this spot as favourable for
their flocks of sheep and goats. These people generally stay on the
higher ground to the north of the river, but, at this season, when
the grass is scorched by the hot sun and grazing is<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span> poor for their animals, they
approach the Niger in order to find pasturage for their flocks.</p>

<p>The river here is more than half a mile wide in its navigable
channel, but there are besides several hundred yards of “borgou”
swamps on either side. Near the villages a channel is cut through
this stuff, by which canoes can approach. Otherwise it forms an
impenetrable mass on the edges of the water. In the hot season the
“borgou” is left isolated, as the river falls, until it dies away
for want of moisture; for water is a necessity to the existence of
this grass.</p>

<p>On the left bank the desert seems to commence almost as soon as
the water is left. Stretches of sand, with a little stunted
vegetation, characterize the country on this side of the Niger. The
ground rises in a series of parallel sand-dunes towards the
interior. On the right bank there is more vegetation, and
apparently more human life.</p>

<p>On the 15th we arrived at the post of Bamba. This little place
is practically the most northern point of the “Bend” of the Niger.
For this reason it has been a favourite objective for the marauding
bands of the desert in the past, and, even now, is sometimes
descended on by a party of these intrepid highwaymen should they
find a good opportunity. It is naturally easier for them to raid
the place geographically nearest their desert wilds, and then to
escape before retribution is visited upon them. At Bamba there are
a French Commissioner and a European in charge of the Post and
Telegraph Office. One curious feature of Bamba is the existence of
a few date palms. These were planted by the Moors during their
occupation of the country about <span class="sc2">a.d.</span> 1500,
and are practically the only ones in the Western Soudan. Dates seen
in the country are generally imported from the oases of the Sahara,
many hundred miles to the northward. Here, much to the delight of
my crew, I gave them a present of a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_240">[240]</span> sheep, and made a longer halt than usual
that evening to give them time to cook it.</p>

<p>The Commissioner, with whom I had dined, came down to the river
to see me off, as I started about 9 p.m.</p>

<p>The effects of a heavy meal of sheep had evidently been too much
for my Bambaras, for I found them one and all sleeping soundly and
snoring lustily. We had great difficulty in arousing them from
their torpor, so that it was considerably after the appointed hour
when we got under way. There was a fair breeze blowing, of which we
took advantage to hoist our sail. The river in this section runs
almost due east, and as the wind is usually from the east or
north-east, we had not previously had an opportunity of trying to
sail. Under the starry sky we sped rapidly along, and I sat outside
for some time, enjoying the cool air and the beautiful tropical
night. In the early morning the wind shifted to its accustomed
quarter, and we found ourselves opposed by a strong easterly gale.
Generally speaking, this wind lasted from 5 a.m. till 11 a.m., and
we made but little progress during these hours. Small wavelets
would play over the face of the Niger, and a heavy spray would be
blown on board.</p>

<p>The river was now at its widest, and from shore to shore must
have been well over three miles. How strange it seemed to look at
this vast, broad stream and to think of its appearance when I first
saw it at its birth, near the Tembikunda Mountains. It had
travelled far since those days, having covered about 1200 miles.
This portion of the river contains many islands, which are covered
by water when the Niger rises, but are the habitation of Fulani and
Tuareg with their herds and flocks at this time of the year.
Landing on these islands for the evening halt, one was always sure
of finding some duck and teal in the ponds and swamps upon
them.</p>

<p>The red-fronted gazelle and kob are plentiful. The<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span> former is found chiefly on the
left bank, as being more sandy and desert-like, while the latter
has its favourite haunts on the right bank, where the marshy ground
is suited to its habits. On the left bank I was informed there were
giraffe, but I never saw their tracks. I think, however, that it is
very probable giraffe are found between Bamba and Bourem, where the
country seems well suited to them. Senegal haartebeest are on both
banks. In the river there are a few hippo pools, but hippopotami
did not seem as plentiful here as they had been higher up the
Niger. The stately marabout and the picturesque crown-bird were
both familiar objects on the Niger landscape. The latter bird was
particularly common about here, and was easy to approach. The
crown-bird, or crested crane, is certainly one of the handsomest
birds found on this part of the Niger, for its fine plumage and
quaint straw-coloured crest at once distinguish it from the
ordinary waterfowl here seen.</p>

<p>On the 16th of April, about 7 a.m., we approached the Defile of
Tosaye. This was rather an interesting point in the Niger scenery,
for here, for the first time since the Rapids of Kienefala, near
Bamako, the river gathers a more rapid current. On the whole the
Niger current is sluggish, as the fall of the land from the
Tembikunda Mountains to the sea is so gradual. But at Tosaye the
stream is forced through a narrow defile, and the water, which just
before was spread over a breadth of at least two miles, is
compressed into a width of 500 to 600 yards. The rush of water is
remarkable in comparison to the slow, steady flow to which we had
so long been accustomed.</p>

<p>The entrance to the defile is a pretty sight. On either side
there begins to appear a low ridge of laterite rocks, which
gradually rises to a height of forty feet above the level of the
stream, in a precipitous mass. The whole length of the defile is
three miles, while three distinct<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_242">[242]</span> rocky barriers cross the river
transversely. These transverse barriers render navigation dangerous
and arduous. A fourth barrier, passing longitudinally up and down
stream, divides the waterway into two nearly equal passages. The
current flows at a rate of six to eight knots an hour at this time
of year, but when the river is in full flood the rush of water must
be tremendous. In the channels themselves there are numerous jagged
rocks projecting, or half-hidden under water. Navigation,
therefore, is a risky business, and the frail native canoes often
get dashed to pieces against one of them. There is an old French
fort, at a bend in the defile, perched on the top of the rocks on
the right bank. The place is now disused, but was built originally
to command the Tosaye defile when the French first occupied this
portion of the country. Except for this narrow fringe of rocks on
each side, the country is of a sandy nature, covered with the usual
sparse, desert-like vegetation.</p>

<p>On emerging from the defile the transition is almost as rapid as
it was on entering Tosaye, for the rocks rapidly disappear, the
river quickly resumes its former width, and the current reverts to
its normal pace.</p>

<p>About twenty miles below Tosaye is the post of Bourem. The chief
interest of Bourem lies in the fact that it is at the mouth of the
“Wad Telemsi,” or “Oued Telemsi.” This is a dried-up watercourse,
descending from the heart of the Sahara to the River Niger. In
olden times it must have been an important tributary of the river,
but now water does not flow in it above the surface; below the
surface, however, there is water, and for this reason there is a
well-defined line of wells along the watercourse, and it forms a
trade route for caravans travelling from the Sahara to the Niger.
It follows that Bourem is a place frequented by caravans, although
it is not of much importance in itself, and these caravans merely
use it as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
halting-place <i>en route</i> to the bigger markets of Gao or
Timbuctu.</p>

<p>At Bourem there is found a curious coloured clay, which is used
for houses. There are three colours of this clay, pink, violet, and
white. The town itself lies up a small branch of the Niger, about
five miles from the main stream. When the river is at its fullest
the main stream covers all the intervening land, making one wide
expanse of water with its small branch, and, at this period, Bourem
has the Niger flowing at its very walls. The town is built on a
high rise of ground, so is at all times clearly visible from the
Niger.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving Tosaye and before arriving at Bourem, the
river takes a decided turn south-east, as it enters on its course
down the big “Bend.” Between this point and a prominent spur on the
left bank, called Mount Tondibi, the width again increases to over
four miles. As Gao is approached the width decreases to about two
miles, and the channel is interrupted by several islands and large
masses of “borgou.” On the right bank a ridge of sand-hills makes
its appearance, running close to the water’s edge. This part of the
country is the centre of a large rice-growing population, the
quality of whose rice, if not the quantity, compares favourably
with that grown in Macina.</p>

<p>At the landing-stage at Gao I was met by a French officer, who
conducted me to the Commandant. As it was late that evening the
Commandant would not hear of business being discussed till the
following day. I was given a comfortable dwelling in the officers’
mess quarters, who, with their usual hospitality, insisted on my
remaining their guest during my stay at Gao. On landing at Gao the
first sight which strikes the visitor is a number of huge skulls of
elephant, set up on high pedestals, adorning the front of the fort.
These animals have been shot at various<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_244">[244]</span> times by the officers stationed at Gao, and
their skulls have been put to this rather singular use. Gao is
quite the best planned station on the Upper and Middle Niger. A
fine avenue of trees has been planted along the river bank; behind
this lie the Commandant’s house, the fort, and the native quarter
respectively. The native quarter has been built some distance away
from the Europeans’ houses, so that there is a fine open space
between them. The houses are substantially built, with big rooms
and lofty flat roofs. The desert is behind the town, so that its
well-to-do appearance is all the more striking.</p>

<p>I came across a class of people here whom I had not previously
met. These were the Armas. They are a fusion of the Moorish and
Sonrhay races, and are found in small groups between Bamba and Gao.
Apparently they are a lazy, good-for-nothing people, who consider
themselves superior to the Sonrhais and refuse to work. Now that
slavery and serfdom are rapidly dying out, this tribe will find
existence somewhat difficult unless they change their habits. The
officer administering Gao told me he had given them notice that if
they did not shortly show some intention of working he would turn
them out of the town. In appearance they are more like the Moors
than the Sonrhais, but are darker than the former. They have their
own quarter in the place, and also have a mosque to themselves.</p>

<p>There are two fine mosques at Gao, one of which is three
centuries old.</p>

<p>At Gao I used to stroll in the evening on the flat roof of my
abode and gaze over the vast desert stretched out in front of me,
wondering what adventures that solemn, forbidding expanse held in
store for me.</p>

<p>The Commandant had arranged for camels for me and a guide, but
they would not be ready for a few days, so I had a little time to
complete my preparations. In the meantime the Commandant did his
best to dissuade me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
from attempting to cross the desert, wishing me to return to Europe
through Dahomey, which was the quickest way from Gao. His reasons
were that my journey would be difficult and dangerous, and my
chances of arriving at the other end of the Sahara in safety were
remote. He said that quite recently they had had reports of the
movement of a marauding party of Arabs who were within easy reach
of the line of wells I should probably follow. Further, there was a
bad stretch of desert to be crossed, called the Tanezrouft, in
which there were no wells for seven days, and, at this hot season
of the year, the passage of this waterless tract would be
particularly arduous. I dare say he felt that it was his duty to
try to dissuade me from my enterprise, and probably thought besides
that he might be held responsible should any mishap befall me.</p>

<p>With some difficulty I explained that before leaving Sierra
Leone I was aware of the hardships and dangers likely to be
encountered, and that I should be extremely foolish to turn back at
this point of my travels. Moreover, having obtained permission for
the journey, I had no intention of abandoning it now. I think he
was finally convinced that I was firm in my resolves, and he then
gave up further attempts to shake them. To avoid any possibility of
blame being attached to him in the event of any accident to me, I
signed a paper stating that he had tried to make me abandon my
desert journey, but in spite of his warnings I had decided to carry
it out. He was particularly distressed because he could not send an
escort with me, for in the hot season most of the camels of his
troops were out at pasturage, and many had not recovered from their
hard work of the previous cold season. However, I told him I had
never expected to have an escort, and he must not be anxious on
that account. As it happened, he was sending some stores and
ammunition to a French detachment at a place called Kidal, about
170 miles north in the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_246">[246]</span> Sahara, and so it was arranged that this
escort should accompany me, as Kidal lay on my route.</p>

<p>In the meantime we arranged a small hunting expedition to occupy
the time till my camels should be ready. One of the French officers
and I planned to go out to a place about one day’s march distant to
hunt giraffe.</p>

<p>We pitched our camp a few miles from the Niger on its right
bank; it was a place with a reputation for being frequented by
giraffe, and I had great hopes of getting a shot at one. The
country was of the usual sandy nature, with a certain amount of
mimosa and scrubby vegetation. The giraffe is extremely fond of the
mimosa tree, so it seemed likely I might find them at their
feeding-time about here. This interesting animal is very hard to
see, as its curious speckled colour assimilates well with the sandy
surroundings, while its long neck peeps through the leafy top of a
mimosa and is hardly discernible. Giraffes come down to the Niger
to drink at night, returning before dawn to their feeding-grounds
in the interior, and for this reason they are difficult to come
across. Besides, they are very shy. A giraffe will usually perceive
you long before you have perceived him, and he can travel both fast
and far in a day. A curious fact about the giraffe near Gao is that
they are said often to break the telegraph wire with their long
necks as they go down to the Niger to drink, for they do not notice
the thin wire as they pass it.</p>

<p>It seems a pity that large numbers of these giraffe are
slaughtered annually by the natives for their skins, which are used
to make shoe-soles, purses, etc. The giraffe is only found in
comparatively few places now, and it is to be feared that it will
soon be exterminated in this part of Africa, should stringent
measures not be adopted to prevent its wholesale massacre. The
giraffe here seemed generally to be in small numbers. I never
noticed the tracks of more than three together. In those cases
there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span> seemed to be
one a great deal smaller than the other two, which makes one
imagine that they do not breed much, there being only one baby in
most of these families. The natives hunt giraffe on horseback,
pursuing them many miles inland until they get weary, when they are
easier to approach. A horse will generally wear down a giraffe,
although the latter has a greater turn of speed.</p>

<p>Our camp at Gangaber was suddenly broken up by the news that the
camels and guide would be ready two days sooner than I had
expected, so we returned to Gao at once without getting a shot at
giraffe.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE preparations to be made for a journey
across the Sahara are many, as I soon found out at Gao. It was not
merely a question of arranging for the hire of camels and the
services of a guide, but various other points wanted careful
attention.</p>

<p>To start with, the baggage had to be made up in loads suitable
for camel transport, and, naturally, on a pack animal a far more
accurate adjustment of weights is necessary than is the case with
carriers. Besides, I found that cases of provisions, my tin
travelling bath, and even my camp table (Uganda pattern), were the
reverse of being comfortable loads on the desert camel, although
they had been very compact for transport on porters’ heads. All
these things had to be either left behind or put into leathern
bags, called “mesoued.” A bag is quite the easiest form of baggage
for a camel to carry. Two of these can be slung over the
pack-saddle, and the weights easily adjusted by taking something
out of the heavier and adding it to the lighter one. No ropes are
necessary to tie a “mesoued” on to the saddle, while boxes and
such-like loads have to be strapped round with cords, and tied on
to hooks on the pack-saddle. These ropes, however strong, break
sooner or later, with the result that your cases fall<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span> with a crash to the ground and
the contents are probably scattered in all directions.</p>

<p>As this was my first experience of the desert I had to learn all
these little points, but, fortunately for me, my French friends
helped me with much practical advice, making my task much easier. I
had to retain some of my cases, however, as sufficient bags were
not forthcoming, and I rather unwisely decided to retain my bath.
Although water would be scarce on the way, I could not help
thinking that the luxury of a bath when I did arrive at a well
would be too great to forego!</p>

<p>I replenished my stock of rice so as to have sufficient to
ration my servant and guide, and at the same time I carefully
overhauled my tinned provisions. My supply of the latter was
decidedly low, but there were no means of increasing it now;
besides, I had made up my mind to live on the simplest fare, such
as farinaceous food, in order not to augment unduly the number of
camels in my caravan by having too many loads. I had, however, to
arrange for sufficient rations to last till my arrival at Insalah,
in about seven weeks’ time. I was informed that at the oasis of
Insalah I should be able to reprovision myself for the remainder of
the desert journey.</p>

<p>Another most important item for consideration was the means for
carrying water. Big glass demijohns are impracticable in the
desert. They make the water hot, and are extremely likely to break,
should a camel drop its load, or even if the beast should knock up
against one of his fellows, in his usual clumsy manner. The French
use two kinds of water-carriers. The one mostly used, and
invariably used by the nomads of the desert, is a leather
water-skin, called “guerba,” which is generally porous, and
therefore leaks to a certain extent, but keeps the water cool, and
is easily slung on a camel’s back.</p>

<p>The other kind is an iron or aluminium cylindrical
vessel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span> which can
be locked if necessary, and cannot break. The water therein
contained gets very hot, but is never wasted as in a “guerba.” I
was obliged to take “guerbas,” as no metal carriers were available.
And I provided myself with eight of these.</p>

<p>In connection with the subject of water, which is, indeed, the
vital item in desert marches, I had to arrange to have some means
of drawing water from a well. This is a more serious problem than
may be thought, for wells in the Sahara are often seventy yards or
more deep. In one case I recollect there was a well over 330 feet
deep! To draw water from such a depth a long rope of hide is
required, at the end of which is attached a leather bucket, called
“délou.” Spare material of all kinds must be carried, as a caravan
must be absolutely self-contained from start to finish, and any
omissions in calculating requisite stores are likely to be heavily
paid for in the desert.</p>

<p>All gear has to be thoroughly tested as to its strength and
durability before embarking on a journey, and this is a matter to
be attended to personally, for a native cannot be trusted.</p>

<p>Of course, two most important items are the camels and the
guide. My animals belonged to the Kountah Arabs, who wander in that
part of the Sahara north of Gao, while the guide was also a Kountah
Arab, named Sidi Mahomed. I had a second guide for the journey as
far as Kidal, a Tuareg, from the Ifora country, through which I
should pass.</p>

<p>The camels were rather a sorry-looking lot of animals, whose
aspect was not reassuring to a person about to start on a long
desert march, but the Kountah chief, from whom I hired them,
vouched for their ability to take me and my belongings safely to
Kidal. I had no intention of keeping these camels or the guides
beyond Kidal, but would hire a fresh caravan there. The
Commandant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span> kindly
helped in this matter by sending a camel-runner in advance to the
officer commanding the post at Kidal, to prepare camels and a guide
for me. These camel-couriers travel much faster than a caravan. We
calculated to take twelve days over the journey, whereas he would
accomplish it in five or six. The courier’s mount is a
fast-trotting camel, which at a pinch can cover about fifty miles a
day.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw3" id="i24"><img src="images/i24.jpg" alt=

<div>
<p class="sc">The Departure from Gao</p>

<p class="justify">The loads are being adjusted before my caravan
starts on its long trek across the Sahara. All baggage has to be
securely bound with rope to the pack-saddle, as the camel has a
playful way of ridding himself of a load by shaking his unwieldy
frame, by kicking violently with his grotesque hind-legs, or by
rubbing the offending package vigorously against a neighbour’s
flanks until he succeeds in dislodging it.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the 23rd of April all was ready, and I decided to start that
afternoon, so as to avoid marching in the day when it was hot. As I
gazed for the last time at the broad, calm bosom of the Niger,
flowing gently by the walls of Gao on its way to the sea, I could
not help feeling rather serious, and wondering when I should again
see running water, if, indeed, ever. Before me was the unknown
mystery of the great Sahara Desert, and in it I was to pass many
long and weary days before I should arrive in a country watered by
running streams. How often should I not long for a glimpse of the
cool, rippling river I was now looking on for the last time! For
days I must be content with the sight of a well, if I was to see
any water at all; and, at the time, I hardly realized how welcome
the sight of that well would be. About 4 p.m., as the sun was
losing its power, having bidden adieu to my good hosts at Gao, I
prepared to start.</p>

<p>All the Europeans at the station were assembled to see me off. I
fully believe most of them thought I should never reach my
destination. I promised the Commandant to write to him as soon as I
reached Insalah to announce my safe arrival so far. There were many
cameras raised to get a snapshot of my party before their
departure, and then we were off.</p>

<p>My escort consisted of one non-commissioned officer and six
soldiers, all natives, belonging to the Senegalese Tirailleurs. I
had one riding-camel for myself and four<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_252">[252]</span> baggage camels, one of the latter being
lightly laden, and carrying my servant for a portion of the day’s
march. The remaining camels, numbering eighteen, were carrying
Government stores for Kidal. I waited behind to allow the string of
camels to file off in front of me before mounting my own animal,
and following in their wake.</p>

<p>I intended to march till sunset that evening, and then halt for
a few hours’ rest until the moon got up. As soon as the moon rose I
would start again, and march till eight or nine the following
morning. I was anxious to march as little as possible during the
day because of the intense heat. Besides, most of the tirailleurs
were on foot, and night marching would be less fatiguing for them.
The predominant question of water also had to be thought of, as a
man wants to drink less if halted in the heat than if he is
marching at that time.</p>

<p>The southern portion of the Sahara about Gao is desert in the
sense of being a deserted land, that is to say a land without any
fixed inhabitants. There are comparatively few parts of the Sahara
which are absolutely deserted by mankind, for almost the whole of
this lonely region has a population of nomads. These nomads, it is
true, are very few in numbers, and rarely stay in one spot for any
length of time. Their movements are dictated by two things.
Firstly, the state of the pasturage in the locality where they are
is an all-important factor. Nomads of the desert must of necessity
be mounted on camels, chiefly, if not entirely, for they are the
only animals adapted to an existence which entails long periods
without water. But camels, like other animals, must feed fairly
regularly, although they can live some time without drinking, hence
the necessity for these nomads to have pasturage for their beasts.
The nomad then remains in a certain locality in the desert for as
long as there is food for his camels; he then moves on to a fresh
spot with suitable feeding for his camels.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_253">[253]</span> To a large extent the proximity and quality
of the water in the nearest wells are of minor importance to the
question of a good pasturage. The desert nomad has perforce to be a
hardy creature or he would very soon die of starvation or thirst.
His wants in the way of food are small and easily satisfied, while
he trains himself to exist, like his camel, on little water. To a
large extent he suits his life and movements to the welfare of his
beast.</p>

<p>Now, although the southern portion of the Central Sahara is a
deserted country, the greater part of the section inhabited by the
Kountah Arabs and the Ouilli-miden Tuaregs, viz. from the latitude
of Bourem to the latitude of Zinder, is comparatively fertile in a
certain kind of vegetation. This vegetation is of a peculiar kind,
but includes the mimosa shrub and cram-cram grass, besides other
things the camel likes to feed on. There is comparatively little
space with no vegetation of some kind growing upon it. Water is
scarce everywhere, and is only found in wells, but it is rare that
one has to march more than sixty miles without passing a well.</p>

<p>For the first nine days my route lay through the country of the
Kountahs. We seldom met any people, however. Occasionally, at a
well, one would come across a few men drawing water, which they
would load up on camels, or sometimes on donkeys, and thus
transport it to their encampment, which was probably some miles
distant, and generally far away from the possible tracks of a
passing caravan. I suppose the mere fact of a man electing to pass
his life in the Sahara is a sufficient indication that, for some
reason or other, he wishes to shun other mortals as much as
possible. His motive may be a criminal one, or merely the desire
for a hermit existence; whichever it is, in the case of these
people, there is no doubt that they have a decided reluctance to
coming into contact with strangers, unless for purposes of
loot!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
</p>

<p>The route I had taken was not the shortest one to Kidal. My
quickest way would have been through Kerchouel, a well almost due
north of Gao, and to the east of my direction, but the guide said
that this line of wells via Kerchouel was in a bad state. According
to him several of the wells were dry, or had so little water as to
be insufficient for even our small caravan. I afterwards discovered
that the man was lying, and, for private reasons, did not wish to
go by Kerchouel, for the wells there were no drier than were those
on our route. It so happened that this particular year had been a
drier one than usual, and all the wells were in a lower condition
than usual for the time of year.</p>

<p>In this portion of the Sahara there is a periodical rainfall,
which, of course, accounts for the vegetation being less poor than
elsewhere. The rainfall consists of some three or four tornadoes,
averaging possibly one or two inches in the year. These tornadoes
come between the months of July and September, and it is due to
them that the wells fill up. Sometimes a well, or line of wells in
an “oued,” fill up when there is apparently no rain that year, but
this is to be attributed to the fact that rain has fallen in some
far-off locality—possibly at a distance of a hundred miles—and, by
some curious subterranean system, there is a connection between the
spot where the rain has fallen and the particular “oued” in which
the wells are situated. The whole question of where the water
originates which fills up certain wells in the Sahara is a
complicated and interesting one. Until all the desert has been
thoroughly surveyed it will be difficult to do more than guess at
the solution of some of these problems.</p>

<p>One article of baggage which I had brought, and which I thought
would be of the greatest value in the Sahara, was my tent. When
halting during the middle of the day the heat was intense. Shade
was scarce, for the mimosas, the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_255">[255]</span> nearest approach to trees, were at the best
stunted shrubs, affording little shade. My tent, however,
consisting as it did of a single fly, seemed to retain the heat to
a great extent, although, of course, it afforded some welcome
shade. I found the hours from 11 a.m. till 3 p.m. most trying. It
was so hot that it was difficult to work, yet it was much too hot
to sleep. I always welcomed the hour for the evening departure.
Marching was certainly cooler than halting, and often it was less
tiring.</p>

<p class="justify">The last signs of life before entering the
waterless desert of Tanezrouft.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>I usually rode for the first two hours, and about sunset
dismounted to rest my camel and to stretch my legs. If it was a
moonlight night I used to walk for several hours, but on a dark
night walking was not so pleasant. The country about here was
usually open, and it was possible to march, even on a moonless
night, without fear of the camels coming to grief.</p>

<p>It was a strange place this desert, and gave me a queer, eerie
feeling. On all sides a death-like stillness prevailed; for hours,
and sometimes for days, we would walk without seeing a single soul.
For miles there would be no signs of animal life, then suddenly a
herd of gazelle would come into view, feeding on the desert,
scrubby grass, and at the sight of the caravan away they would
scamper, frightened at the unwonted sight of man.</p>

<p>In this part of the Sahara there were a fair number of Loder’s
gazelle. This creature can live without water, and its habitat is
always a desert country. It obtains a certain amount of moisture
from the sap in certain plants and grasses, which appears to amply
suffice for the little animal. The gazelle is a very pale, creamy
buff colour, almost white under the belly, and stands twenty-eight
inches high. It is extremely graceful, like most gazelle, and
almost invariably starts its flight, when disturbed, by a series of
big bounds, wherewith to gain impetus. I generally saw about six in
a herd, but sometimes I have<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_256">[256]</span> known them to include as many as twenty.
The venison formed an excellent change from ordinary diet, and was,
of course, the only chance of getting fresh meat in the desert. The
nomads, whom we occasionally met near a well, had flocks of goats
and sheep, but would not sell their animals for untold quantities
of “guinée.”</p>

<p>Quite in the southernmost parts of the Sahara, within thirty or
forty miles of the Niger, I saw a few greater bustard, and at
times, when near a well, I have even seen guinea-fowl several days’
march from the river. As there was no running water for them to
drink at, I can only conclude that these birds used to go down the
wells to drink. In the same way I saw ringdoves near wells once or
twice, far in the interior of the Sahara, and have often watched
them emerging from the well after having drunk. These doves, too,
appear to be of a far lighter colour than the ordinary grey dove of
West Africa and the Niger. The hue is a very pale slaty grey, so
pale as to be almost white. In this connection it is strange to
note how pale is the colour of every Saharan animal, for it seems
to conform to the usual law of nature in assimilating its colouring
to its surroundings, so that it is frequently very difficult to
detect an animal against the white Saharan sand. The soil is,
however, by no means altogether sandy. In parts of the desert here
the landscape varied a good deal. After marching through many miles
of sandy soil with the typical desert scrub, the scene would
gradually change. Isolated hills, standing 200 feet above the
plain, would appear. These hills were formations of ferruginous
rock, covered with boulders, but devoid of vegetation. The ground
here used to be strewn with a layer of shale, presumably broken off
in a kind of flakes from the hills by the heat of the sun, and
scattered over the surface by the desert winds.</p>

<p>I recollect one of the most trying marches on the way
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span> Kidal was the
day we arrived at the Well of Agamhor. We had been two days on the
march since the last well, and, by the guide’s information and by
my rough calculations, we should arrive at the well by 10 or 11
a.m. As there was no suitable place to camp for the day and get a
little shade, at 9 a.m., contrary to my usual practice, I decided
to push on to the well and march, if necessary, till eleven. It was
one of the hottest days we had experienced, and we were marching
over a rocky ridge, which radiated the heat with intense
fierceness. I was rather exhausted, too, as I had had a long stalk
that morning after some white oryx, before I had managed to shoot
one. We trudged steadily on till long after eleven, and still there
was no sign of the well. The guide then began to urge that we
should halt, saying the well was still far away and we could not
reach it till 3 p.m. The men and camels were fatigued and hot, so I
decided to halt. Until 4 p.m. we lay gasping on the rocky, burning
ground, vainly trying to get some shade. It was not possible to
pitch my tent, as the soil was too hard, so I followed the men’s
example by lying on the shady side of two or three articles of
baggage. The sun was pitiless, there was no pasturage for the
camels in that barren spot, and we were all thankful to start once
more late in the afternoon. We did not arrive at the well till
nearly eleven o’clock that night, when both men and beasts threw
themselves down exhausted, glad to stop where they lay till
morning-time.</p>

<p>The camels after this march began to show signs of fatigue;
several, too, had got terribly sore backs. These sore backs had not
altogether developed on the march, for I had noticed them suffering
from barely healed wounds before we left Gao. I had been assured,
however, that it was very rare to get a hired camel without a
tender place on his back, so there seemed to be nothing to do but
accept the situation. I used to dress their wounds daily
with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span> iodoform and
cotton-wool, but it was almost as painful to me to see them loaded
as it must have been to themselves. I lightened the loads as much
as possible, but most of my kit had to be carried if I hoped ever
to reach the other side of the Sahara, so I had to harden my heart
and ignore the pain they must have sometimes endured. The Bambara
soldiers, when charging a camel, are quite callous. But they do
not, and I suppose never will, understand the beast. Being negroes,
they are totally unconscious of the pain animals can suffer. Of
course, it must be said that they are not natives of a camel
country, and so are handicapped by a lack of knowledge of the
beast, when they are enlisted in camel corps. I think they never
quite appreciate the necessity for giving the camel a regular
number of hours daily in a pasturage whenever it is possible, and
they certainly are not as careful about watering him as are the
nomads of the desert, who are brought up from their childhood to
look after camels.</p>

<p>The camel is a curious-tempered animal. He seems to have the
same characteristic as most desert nomads. He dislikes mankind
cordially, and takes no pains to disguise the fact.</p>

<p>To mount a camel he must be made first to squat on the ground.
This is accomplished at the expense of some time and temper, by
pulling his head towards the ground by means of the string in his
nostril and ejaculating frequently a soothing noise similar to what
is used by a nurse when she tries to induce a baby to go to sleep.
The camel at last obeys, with many grunts and “protests.” The next
operation is to mount. The first point is to seize the rein in your
right hand and place this hand on the front of the saddle. At the
same time you must seize the camel’s nostril in your left hand,
turning his head inwards until the nose nearly reaches the front of
the saddle. Every movement on your part will call forth numerous
deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span> growls of
protest, but one soon gets accustomed to this, and takes no notice
of it. When, however, you seize the nostril and pull his head round
he will roar as if he were being tortured to death. It is advisable
to place the left foot on the slack part of the rein on the ground,
or he may take you by surprise and suddenly jump up.</p>

<p class="sc">The Wells of Tabankhor</p>

<p class="justify">The difficulty of discerning a well in the
Sahara, until one is actually within a few paces of it, is here
clearly indicated. The well is rarely marked by any distinctive
features, such as trees, vegetation, or any particular accident in
the ground. It is merely a hole excavated in the sand, which can
only too easily be missed by the traveller, possibly with serious
consequences should he be short of water. The donkeys and bullock
in the illustration belonged to Kountah Arabs in the Southern
Sahara, and on the right are seen water-skins just filled from the
well ready to be laden on the beasts for transport to the Arab
encampment in the desert hard by.</p>

<div>
<p class="sc">A Snapshot of the “King of Beasts” amid his Natural
Surroundings</p>

<p class="justify">This was a lucky snapshot of a lion going to
drink, on a branch of the Middle Niger. Having news of a “kill,” I
managed during the day to get into a concealed position near his
lair. Fortune favoured me when the lion emerged from his
resting-place, passing within a few paces of me on his way to the
water.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Having successfully accomplished all these manœuvres, you should
rapidly throw the right leg over the saddle, lifting the left foot
from the rein and placing it on] his neck. The camel will then
generally—but not always— rise with a most disconcerting jerk,
growling loudly all the while. This is perhaps the most awkward,
and even dangerous, moment for the unwary novice. On rising the
camel first throws his head and body forward and then backward with
lightning-like rapidity, when the rider must conform by equally
rapidly jerking his own body in the inverse directions, otherwise
he will inevitably lose his balance and be hurled on the ground.
The Saharan camel is not a well-trained animal, so it behoves one
to be careful when first attempting to mount an unknown beast.</p>

<p>After having mounted the rider will not persuade him to cease
his angry grumbles for some little time. If he refuses to rise, as
he sometimes does, the only plan is to tap more or less violently
with the feet on his neck; but in every case the golden rule is to
have patience, for of all the brutes in creation which have been
tamed to do man’s will, the camel is surely the most trying. I have
sometimes spent ten minutes in endeavouring to make a camel rise,
when I was in a particular hurry to be off. Beating is quite
ineffectual, and only serves to humble one’s pride. A camel’s hide
is pretty tough, and he cares little for the blow from a thick
stick or whip.</p>

<p>The camel never seems really happy unless he is absolutely left
to himself. Far away from mankind, and unobserved, he eats and eats
till he is gorged, and then lies<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_260">[260]</span> down to sleep. If man is at hand he will
never eat as well as when by himself; the presence of a human being
seems to have a strange effect on him. This has been often proved
by noticing the difference between camels left at their pasturage
in perfect liberty and those which are guarded by men while
feeding. The former regain condition comparatively quickly, while
the latter, besides taking longer, will probably never return to
such good form as their more fortunately placed brothers who are
grazing quite at liberty. When near a man he constantly seems to
sulk and not to make the best of himself. I have known camels in
the Sahara, who had not had anything to eat for several days,
refuse their food after being ill-treated, seemingly preferring to
die than to accept any favour from the person who has beaten
them.</p>

<p>Although camels can go several days without water, yet, when
they do drink, they are gluttons for it. They drink an abnormally
large quantity at a time, and will return to drink two or three
times in the day until satisfied. Camels suffer a good deal from
indigestion, and this is probably due to the huge quantities of
food and water they consume.</p>

<p>It was the custom to hobble our animals at night, and I
recollect how on one occasion on this march to Kidal, my plans for
the next day’s journey were upset by a freak on their part. We
halted one night, rather tired after a long march, about eleven
o’clock. The road was rough, as we had entered into a mountainous,
rocky country, and it was impossible to move any further until the
sun rose, the moon having just set. It so happened that there was
an excellent pasturage in an “oued” close by, and into this the
camels were turned after being hobbled for the night.</p>

<p>I awoke next morning at daybreak to find all except four of the
brutes had disappeared. They had wandered off, moving, as they do
when hobbled, by a series of little jumps, in the direction from
which we had come the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_261">[261]</span> previous evening. I sent a party to track
them. They had gone back a distance of fifteen miles to our last
halting-place, and were found quietly grazing there, quite
unconcerned at the trouble they had given us! The incident made me
lose a valuable day. It was not the slightest use to get angry, so
I resigned myself to such incidents quite meekly at last. Camels
will wander extraordinary distances in search of water when very
thirsty. I heard of a case where two camels had gone back a six
days’ march to the previous well, when, had they only known it, the
next well was only one day’s march ahead! Usually they have a keen
instinct for the presence of water, and when they have been to a
well, along a certain route, they will recollect the road in a
wonderful manner.</p>

<p>Cases of guides having lost their way, and having then trusted
themselves to the memory of the camel, by allowing him to go in the
direction he selects, are frequently repeated. The camel in such
cases generally, although, of course, not invariably, brings the
caravan safely to the well. It must be understood that this will
not occur unless the animal has followed that route on previous
occasions, and further, that he must in such cases usually be
within a few miles, at most, of the well.</p>

<p>One rather unpleasant feature about these Sahara camels is the
number of ticks they collect. These loathsome insects find a
habitation on all camels, and are difficult to destroy.</p>

<p>I was advised to ride barefoot in the desert, but never could
persuade myself to try on account of the fear of ticks. As I
previously mentioned, the camel is here ridden with the rider’s
feet on the animal’s neck, and I used always to wear long
riding-boots made of soft leather with soft soles. If heavy-soled
boots are worn the camel’s neck will get chafed from the constant
friction of the leather against his skin. The hair of the mane of a
riding-camel is invariably<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_262">[262]</span> worn away on account of the pressure of the
rider’s feet, and a riding-camel can generally be distinguished by
this mark.</p>

<p>Stirrups are never used with the camels of the Central and
Western Sahara. All camels are trained by Tuaregs or Arabs, from
whom they are bought, and these two races never ride with stirrups,
but with their feet on the animal’s neck. The camel is guided by
the feet, and he is urged forward by repeated taps of the feet on
his neck. The rein can hardly be said to guide him, and is
certainly never put to this use by the desert nomads. The rein
generally is attached to a ring in his right nostril, being then
brought under his neck to the near side. Its chief use is to haul
up the animal’s head when he, in his pig-headed way, will lower it
to graze against your wishes.</p>

<p>A camel’s walk is a most tiring motion. He sways you from side
to side as well as from front to rear. It is something like being
in a ship when she is both pitching and tossing. I never got used
to the movement, and for the first few weeks used to get painfully
stiff and sore.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">OWING to the heat and the fine particles of
sand constantly flying in the air, Sidi Mahomed, the Arab guide,
became much troubled with his eyes, developing a kind of
ophthalmia. I had then to depend entirely on the Tuareg guide, and
it was soon evident that he was not very reliable. We were marching
towards the wells of Tinderan, and on the afternoon of the 30th of
April we should have arrived there. Time went on, and it began to
get dark, while there were still no signs of the wells. On being
interrogated, the guide, with customary vagueness, said it was only
a short way off, and we should soon be at Tinderan. There was no
moon that night, and I soon perceived the ground was becoming very
rough; the camels began to stumble into holes and over boulders,
until it seemed hazardous to proceed for fear that one would break
his leg. It seemed to me that the guide had lost his way. I
decided, however, not to interfere with him, as it is a principle
in the desert not to harry the guide with questions, since it only
flurries him. One is perforce dependent absolutely on one’s guide,
so it is the best policy to rely thoroughly on him and leave him
alone if he seems puzzled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
</p>

<p>As the stars became brighter in the heavens I noticed that we
had altered our course from east-north-east to south-east, and
gradually we began to turn still further south. There was then no
doubt that the Tuareg had lost himself. I halted the caravan,
proceeding to question him. He denied that he had lost the way,
protesting that we were quite close to Tinderan. However, it was
palpable that he must have missed his direction, so without further
listening to his protests I camped where we were for the night,
sending him off to find the right way, and telling him not to
return till he had so done. Anyhow, it was fairly evident that he
did not understand how to march by the stars, for we had turned
nearly through an angle of 180 degrees, and were now with our backs
to the direction in which I knew Tinderan must lie. Should he not
succeed in soon finding the wells the position threatened to become
serious, for we had nearly exhausted the supply of water on the
camels. It was two days’ march back to the last well, whither we
must return should the worst come to the worst, and the strictest
economy with our water would not make it suffice for that time. I
resolved to keep the water intact till to-morrow anyhow, and see
what news the dawn would bring. So that night we went to bed
thirsty. Eventually it was not till late the following afternoon
that we arrived at Tinderan, weary and parched. We had been nearly
eight miles out of the true direction, it appeared, the previous
night. The general sense of relief, and the men’s joy at the sight
of the wells, are not easily described. We had practically no water
remaining in the water-skins, and what there was had a disgusting
stagnant taste. The sun had been overpoweringly hot, for we had
been forced to march through the heat of the day, and the sense of
mistrust in our guide was universal. What feelings of relief and
comfort did not these wells conjure up! Tinderan meant water to
drink, a good rest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
for weary limbs, food and sleep, and for myself, also the delights
of a wash once more!</p>

<div class="figcenter iw3" id="i28"><img src="images/i28.jpg" alt=

<div>
<p class="sc">My Kitchen in the Desert</p>

<p class="justify">In the foreground is my servant, Musa, cooking
my breakfast. At this spot we were so fortunate as to find some
stunted mimosas, so that, with the aid of a rug thrown over some
branches, I was able to rig up a little shelter against the blazing
rays of the Saharan sun.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>To the ordinary observer, it is true, Tinderan was hardly an
attractive-looking place. It lay in the midst of typical Saharan
scenery. Wastes of yellowish white sand surrounded it on all sides.
Besides the wells there was, of course, nothing else at Tinderan,
for that was simply the name of the wells. There were some
half-dozen of them, consisting merely of holes excavated in the
sand, and not discernible until one actually walked up to them. But
to the desert traveller, tired and thirsty, the surroundings
mattered little; the chief point, and the only point, was that here
was water and plenty of it. For the time being all hardships are
forgotten and joy reigns supreme.</p>

<p>On our march to Tinderan we had finally left the “Oued Telemsi,”
the dried-up watercourse along which we had been travelling since
leaving the Niger, and were now on the northern confines of the
Kountah Arabs’ country. Just before quitting the Telemsi we had
crossed two other “oueds,” called Northern and Southern Eguerrer
respectively. These are big shallow valleys, and must at one time
have been two large streams which united south of Tinderan to form
the River Telemsi. I saw several herds of Loder’s gazelle in these
“oueds,” and shot three of them just before dusk. We had not had
any meat for some days, so they were a welcome addition to our
larder. It was not till the following day that I again saw some
White Oryx (<i>Oryx leucoryx</i>). These fine antelope are
extremely local in this part of the Sahara. I generally saw them in
a locality where there was rocky ground as well as sand. A
favourite spot for these animals would be a sandy “oued” with
“cram-cram” grass growing in its bed, and on each side barren,
rocky hills. They appear to care little for shade, feeding in the
early morning in the “oued” and retiring to the rocky, shadeless
hills during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span> the
heat of the day. They invariably seemed to be well-fed and in good
condition, and one cannot help marvelling at the sustenance they
seem to get out of such a poor-looking diet. The white oryx is a
dangerous animal to approach if wounded, for he can inflict
terrible wounds with his sharp, spear-like horns on anyone who is
so unwary as to come within reach of them.</p>

<p>On the 1st of May we passed a piece of desert rather different
from anything I had yet seen. For several miles there were clumps
of dead mimosa shrubs, the soil was sand, and the terrain here was
very flat. The appearance of the scene was most dreary; it seemed
as if this had once been a comparatively fertile spot for the
Sahara, when all of a sudden the blight of the desert must have
descended upon it, mercilessly killing every bit of living
vegetation. The guides informed me that there had been no rain
there for five years, hence the destruction of the mimosas.
Although rain in the Sahara is rare, still there are not many
places which are not favoured with a shower, or perhaps two, every
year or every other year, and it is marvellous how this
infinitesimal quantity of moisture will put new life into Saharan
vegetation, making new plants spring up in a very short time. It is
fortunate that this is so, for otherwise even the camel could not
exist in the desert.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of May we saw in front of us a rocky barrier of
mountains, which seemed to block the horizon to the north. These
were the Mountains of Adrar, and we were approaching the Adrar
Plateau, upon which was situated the post of Kidal. All the way
from the Niger we had been gradually rising towards this plateau,
which forms a tableland at an elevation of about 2500 feet in the
south of the Central Sahara. The next two days were the hottest we
experienced. The way lay over burning granite rocks, rough boulders
obstructed our route at every step, while the sun beat down with
pitiless vigour on our heads.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_267">[267]</span> Path, of course, there was none. In the
desert such a thing as a path is unknown; each caravan seeks its
own road. Every guide has his own landmarks to help him, but two
caravans, both destined for the same well and starting from the
same place, might easily pass each other <i>en route</i> without
being in view. The average temperature during those two days was
116 degrees in the shade; our throats were parched, our feet were
burnt, and the glare from the blazing sun was intolerable. Up to
this point I had not adopted sun-spectacles, but now I was forced
to do so. I had taken the precaution to bring three pairs with me,
and the relief to the straining eyes was inexpressible. The chief
objection to them is that they make one’s face perspire to an
uncomfortable degree, and when they are removed it is difficult to
see in the strong sunlight for some minutes.</p>

<p>Until now I had flattered myself that I was fairly well hardened
to the African sun, for I had travelled through the tropical heat,
in the hottest season, during the past three months, with my
sleeves rolled up to the elbow and knickers cut short at the knee.
Now, however, I found that my skin was as tender as a child’s
against the fierce rays of the Sahara sun. My face, arms, and knees
got terribly burnt and swollen. I suffered tortures every time I
touched them or bathed them. The skin came off, and I must have
looked a very peculiar object. Even the natives’ hard feet became
fearfully blistered and swollen by the burning heat of the rocks.
Raids on the water-skins during the march were frequently
attempted, and I had to give the N.C.O. of my escort the strictest
orders to keep the men from the water. If they had been allowed to
drink all they wished the water supply would soon have been
exhausted, and it is always a sound principle to arrive at a well
with some water in your water-skins, for it is never certain in the
desert that the wells will not be found dry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
</p>

<p>Halting in the middle of the day was the time everyone disliked
most, for the heat of those rocks and the lack of any shade were
truly appalling. However, a halt was absolutely necessary for
several hours during the day in order to give the camels a rest, so
I used to stop at some “oued” where there was some parched-up
“cram-cram” for them to feed on. As it was, two of the camels fell
down during the march on the 4th, refusing to get up. They were
exhausted by the heat. I relieved them of their loads, leaving the
guide, Sidi Mahomed, to look after them, and bidding him follow as
soon as they had rested. Those two camels died before reaching
Kidal, and the only wonder was that we did not lose more.</p>

<p>A sandstorm was blowing when we arrived at Kidal on the 5th of
May, about 10 p.m. I shall not easily forget my sensation of joy at
again beholding a European’s face after the past twelve days in the
desert. What a pleasant spot Kidal seemed! Here there were actually
two houses, or huts to be more accurate, built of mud. Further,
there were about a dozen date palms surrounding the little post.
The spectacle of real trees and real green leaves once more was
most refreshing. Then, one need no longer stint oneself for water.
How I revelled in a bath that evening! The water at Kidal was
beautifully pure, not like some of the disgusting liquid we had
been obliged to drink on the way. Almost the strangest thing was
that I had been only twelve days on my journey. It seemed as if I
had spent a lifetime already in the Sahara, so new and varied were
many of the experiences I had undergone. The little hut allotted to
me was very hot, but the relief at being in the shade, and being
able to discard my helmet during the day, was great. Besides, it
was cooler at Kidal. The soil was sandy and those burning granite
rocks were farther away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
</p>

<p>I did not leave Kidal till the 8th of May. I had to reorganize
my caravan here. The officer in charge of the post had fortunately
been able to retain the services of a guide for me, and the same
man was willing to let me his camels if we could agree as to
terms.</p>

<p>The day after my arrival I had an interview with Mohamed Ben
Kaid Kaddour, as the guide was called. He was an Arab trader who
did business between Insalah and the Adrar country. He had not
intended to return to Insalah till the cool season commenced, about
September, but owing to some urgent private affairs he had just
been recalled to the northern part of the desert. The man was a
shrewd Arab, about thirty years old, a keen trader, and with the
reputation of being a sure guide in the desert. The opportunity was
a good one, so I decided to take it at any cost, for, owing to the
time of year—it being the hottest part of the hot season—no
caravans were travelling, and I should be extremely unlikely to get
another guide to take me.</p>

<p>After a good deal of bargaining matters were settled. I hired
four baggage camels and one “mehari,” or riding-camel, from
Mohamed, who agreed to furnish one camel driver for the party and
guide me safely across the desert to Insalah for a sum amounting to
about twenty-three pounds. I naturally stipulated that he should
not be paid until the end of the journey. It seemed to me a good
plan to hire the camels from the man who would act as guide, for in
this way he had more interest in keeping them in good condition. It
was to his advantage to get them fit to Insalah, but certainly I
was rather in the hands of my guide should he prove unscrupulous.
If he wished to make away with me <i>en route</i>, and abscond with
my despatch box and baggage, it might be hard for me to prevent it,
and it would be difficult for the authorities to catch him and
punish him for his crime. However, I was determined to be
very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span> wary, always
sleeping with one eye open and my firearms close beside me.</p>

<p>The other member of the caravan was my servant Musa, while the
guide asked permission to bring four camel loads of merchandise and
a young camel he wished to sell at Insalah.</p>

<p>At Kidal I saw some of the finest camels I had yet seen; these
belonged to the detachment stationed at the post, and had been
bought from the Ifora Tuaregs. These people breed a very fine class
of “mehari,” their riding-camels being renowned for their power and
endurance throughout the Central and Western Sahara. The Iforas are
the Tuaregs who wander in the Adrar country, and it was at Kidal
that I first came into contact with this interesting race of
nomads.</p>

<p>The chief peculiarity of these people is that they always wear a
veil over the lower portion of their faces, which conceals all the
features except the eyes, and sometimes the ears. This veil is made
of blue stuff, generally of the well-known “guinée.” It is called a
“litham.” The use of a “litham” is obvious to anyone who has
travelled in the desert, for it serves to prevent the wearer from
being choked by the clouds of sand which are ever blowing about in
the Sahara. Moreover, it prevents thirst to a remarkable extent. It
is a most essential article of kit for the desert traveller, and I
soon found myself obliged to adopt it. I often used to think that
my appearance in a civilized country would have caused some
astonishment and, probably, not a little merriment. My face was so
swathed in strange objects that very little of it was visible. I
think I might fairly have beaten a motorist in the strange
disguises on my features. My eyes were hidden beneath huge blue
sun-glasses, while the remainder of my face was entirely obscured
by the “litham,” which, in my case, generally consisted of a
handkerchief. I found the same<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_271">[271]</span> objection existed to the “litham” as to the
glasses, but that was quite a minor discomfort, and one very soon
forgotten.</p>

<p>The Iforas share the usual dislike of the Tuareg to contact with
mankind, and with Europeans in particular. They possess an
unenviable reputation as first-class looters and highwaymen. A
weakly guarded caravan passing through certain parts of Adrar runs
a very good chance of being attacked and looted. But in this
respect the Iforas are by no means the worst offenders amongst
desert tribes. They are said to be plucky in war, but will avoid
fighting when possible.</p>

<p>They are intensely jealous for their womenfolk, and are stated
to be ready to die to a man rather than allow their wives and
female relatives to be harmed. The Iforas have two distinct
classes—the Ihaggareen, who are the nobles and govern the various
clans into which the tribe is split, and the Imrads, or middle
class. All menial work is done by slaves, called “beylas.” These
slaves have been captured at various times from various negro
tribes during Tuareg incursions into the Niger country, or else
when a caravan has been plundered.</p>

<p>Iforas are armed with spears, swords, and shields. They dislike
a rifle, and seem to regard it with a strange mixture of contempt
and fear. The swords are of two kinds: one is a cutting sword worn
at the side, and the other, called a “tellak,” is about twelve
inches long, resembling a dagger, and is worn on a leather band on
the left forearm, just below the elbow.</p>

<p>The shields are about six feet high, made of bullock or sheep
hide, and are sometimes rather picturesquely painted with strange
devices on the middle of the front face.</p>

<p>Tuaregs live in encampments, their tents being made of a number
of goatskins sewn together. Or they may erect temporary shelters
made with bits of mimosa branches,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_272">[272]</span> over which is stretched a cloth. It is
extraordinary the number of people that one of the tiny shelters
will accommodate. A family of father, mother, and four children
will in some marvellous fashion find space in one about fifteen
feet long by ten feet wide, while the height of the structure is
not more than four feet.</p>

<p>Tuaregs are rather a handsome race, and the Iforas are not
behind their fellow-tribesmen in this respect. They are usually
tall and slimly built, but very wiry. They have well-cut features,
blue eyes, and a pale complexion. The language is guttural, not
bearing any resemblance to Arabic, which is spoken on the north, or
the Niger languages on the south. The origin of these people is
shrouded in mystery. Tradition says that one of the Tuareg tribes,
probably the Ouilliminden, who are nomads in the Sahara on the east
of the Ifora, came about the seventeenth century from the
Erg-Iguidi, a tract of desert in the north of the Sahara, under the
leadership of their chief, Kari Dena, in search of adventures. The
date appears to correspond with the time they conquered the
Sonrhais and invaded the Niger provinces near Timbuctu, but it is
difficult to establish the authenticity of this legend, for the
people are extremely reticent about themselves, and it is doubtful
if they know much of their past history. In any case, it seems
probable that before they became desert wanderers, they lived in
the northern part of Africa, and were probably conquered and
expelled from their country by the Arabs, being thus induced to
seek a fresh home in the south. After their stronghold, Timbuctu,
was finally wrested from them, they migrated more than ever to the
desert, hence their poverty and dislike for close acquaintanceship
with mankind.</p>

<p>Iforas are wonderful camel-masters. They understand more about
these animals than anyone in the Southern Sahara. Besides, they can
identify a camel in a most<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_273">[273]</span> accurate manner by observing his tracks in
the sand. I have known cases of a Tuareg, on observing the tracks
of several camels at a well, stating that such a one was the track
of such and such a man of his tribe, and that he had been there
three days before our arrival. On verification, all these details
proved to be exact. Iforas are not often at fault in the matter of
tracking by the marks of camels’ feet in the sand. They will tell
you, correct almost to a man, how many a certain caravan numbered;
and when it is recollected that camels usually follow each other in
single file, it will be understood that this is no easy matter.
Besides, the terrain is often hard, so that to the casual observer
there are no tracks whatever discernible.</p>

<p class="sc">Méhariste Camels out at their Pasturage near
Kidal</p>

<p class="justify">The vegetation in the illustration is typical of
that found in the Oueds of Eastern Adrar. It is strange how even
these arid-looking grasses can exist in the Sahara, but Adrar is
fortunate in getting several tornadoes annually and is consequently
richer in vegetation than other parts of this desert. In this
pasturage there were some seventy or eighty camels wandering in
complete liberty, scattered over some ten square miles resting and
putting on flesh after some arduous months’ marching this troop had
recently performed in the desert.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Iforas own large flocks of sheep and goats. Some of the
former are fine animals when the difficulties of grazing are taken
into consideration. These Tuaregs take great pride in their flocks,
and the principal trade between them and other tribes of the Sahara
consists in sheep. Their movements are entirely dictated by the
state of the grazing in the “oueds” for their camels and sheep.
Sometimes I have noticed a Tuareg encampment as much as seven miles
from the nearest well. The encampment is made here on account of
good grazing being available. The fact of having to go seven miles
to the well and seven miles back for his water has no importance
for the Ifora. He drinks little himself, while his sheep are driven
to the well every third day to water, and at the same time
water-skins are filled and brought into camp on camels. The state
of most wells in the Ifora country is for this reason often
disgusting. The flocks, when being watered, are allowed to foul the
wells, so that, for a couple of days after their visit, the
contents are almost undrinkable.</p>

<p>This country, which is really the Eastern Adrar, is generally
known as the Adrar of the Iforas, to differentiate<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span> between it and Western Adrar,
a country in south-west Mauretania, and Adrar Oasis in the Northern
Sahara. The word Adrar merely means mountain in the language of the
Tuareg.</p>

<p>The plateau of Adrar is about 200 miles long and seventy wide.
It consists generally of rocky hills running in parallel ranges
from north to south. In certain parts the granite rock has been
split up by the action of the heat, leaving isolated jagged crags
which stick up in fantastic shapes. The valleys between these hills
usually possess pasturage for camels and sheep, for Adrar of the
Iforas is on the whole a well-watered country; that is to say, it
boasts of periodical rains, which consist of some six or seven
tornadoes in the year. The Iforas for this reason are more
fortunate than many nomad tribes of the desert, who have to seek
much farther afield for a change in their grazing-lands. The
valleys in which are found the “oueds” are generally sandy
bottomed, in sharp contrast to the rest of the country, which is
rocky. Roughly speaking, such was the nature of the country through
which I was going to march for the first portion of the way to
Insalah.</p>

<p>At Kidal I at last resigned myself to parting with my travelling
bath. It was a great wrench to have to discard this luxury, but I
had, by bitter experience, found out that it was not a practical
article in the Sahara. On the way from Gao I had only on two
occasions been able to indulge in the joys of a tub, owing to the
scarcity of water in most of the wells. Moreover, the bath was a
most cumbersome load on a camel, and more than once had it suffered
a severe fall, when some infuriated beast had managed to rid
himself of this troublesome piece of baggage by dint of repeatedly
rubbing against his companions, while kicking and wriggling at the
same time. The net result of all this was not only damage to the
bath, but probably a sore<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_275">[275]</span> back for the animal. So I presented the
bath to my host as a slight return for his hospitality to me.</p>

<p>At Kidal I managed to buy a sackful of dates from an Arab trader
who was doing a little business with the soldiers of the
detachment. These dates were invaluable on the march. They are very
portable and nourishing, although hardly appetizing. Indeed, I ate
so many dates in the Sahara, and generally dates of the coarsest
quality, that I hate the sight of a date to this day. My dates were
packed together in a bag, crushed in a solid, consistent mass. They
were so hard that many required a hammer to break them. I found the
best plan, when there was not time to cook them, or no water, was
to simply suck one at a time. If I tried to bite one it might
easily break my teeth, so I gave up trying. In any case I was very
glad to be able to buy dates here, for my stock of provisions,
except the “couscous” and rice, was growing beautifully but rapidly
less. Of “couscous” and rice I had plenty, but I had not yet got to
the stage of being content with only these simple forms of
food.</p>

<p>Before starting on the second stage of my desert journey I had
thoroughly to overhaul my pack-saddles and the gear appertaining
thereto. I had now gained some experience of the Sahara, and knew
better the parts of equipment that were most likely to get
strained. I also took the precaution to have a large reserve of
ropes, girths, and such-like articles. My water-carriers were
nearly all in bad need of repair, and this was a point requiring
careful attention. A good reserve of these water-skins was
essential.</p>

<p>The French have now a courier who goes at stated times from
Kidal to Insalah and back. The next courier was to take word of my
approach to the Commandant at Insalah, so that he might expect my
arrival about the beginning or middle of June. This courier is a
Tuareg,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span> who has
been procured with some difficulty to carry out this service. He
travels alone, for it has been found that he is less likely to be
interfered with if he does so. His mount is a swift-trotting camel,
and in the dry season he has a spare mount as well. I was informed
that the mails were rarely looted, as, of course, there is nothing
of any value to a desert highwayman in a mail bag. His efforts
would be more likely to be directed to stealing the camel than the
mails, but one individual well mounted has a good chance of
escaping in such a case.</p>

<p>The mail man followed a different line of wells from my proposed
route, so I was unlikely to see him on the way.</p>

<p>On leaving Kidal I dare say my host pitied me at having such a
long, lonely journey in front of me. For my part I could not help
pitying him far more, for I was embarking on new and possibly
stirring experiences, while he, poor fellow, was all alone as far
as Europeans were concerned, tied down for two years of duty in one
of the most dreary of French military posts. He had his work to
occupy him, it is true, but how monotonous must continual service
in a Saharan post be, more especially when a man is the only
representative of his race within nearly 200 miles. Far away from
kith and kin, living in a region almost apart from what is known as
“the world,” where life is hard, food scarce and bad, and
surrounded on all sides by the barren wastes of the desert. His
life was not without a large element of danger, moreover; for a
well-organized marauding band might easily wipe out his small
detachment, and the news would not reach the Niger until the
raiders had made good their escape. But perhaps it was this element
of danger which lent some excitement to his life and made it more
tolerable. I must freely confess that he was a young man who
enjoyed capital spirits, and was as cheerful and versatile as is
usual with his countrymen.</p>

<p>After leaving Kidal on the 8th of May, my route lay<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span> almost due north for a
considerable way. Wells were on the average fifty miles apart on
this stage, that is to say, through the Adrar of the Iforas; but
some of the wells had so much potash in them that the water was
quite undrinkable.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw3" id="i31"><img src="images/i31.jpg" alt=

<div>
<p class="sc">The Wells of Kidal</p>

<p class="justify">About every third day camels are brought to the
wells to drink. In the hottest season these animals can, if well
trained, exist eight to ten days without water, but they rapidly
lose their powers of endurance after the third or fourth day. The
camel standing up, on the left, has just arrived from a long desert
trek; it will be noticed how his ribs stand out. The camel
squatting in the foreground, on the other hand, has drunk his fill,
as is, indeed, indicated by his big barrel and general air of
contentment.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The southern portion of Adrar affords some interesting relics of
the Stone Age. The wells have probably been in existence for many
centuries, and at one or two places we found some curious little
stone implements, such as arrowheads, miniature axes, etc. There
seems to be no doubt that all this country must have been inhabited
at one period by a sedentary population, thus further strengthening
the theory that the Sahara was not always the barren waste it now
is. In the neighbourhood of Es-Souk, some eighty miles north-west
of Kidal, there are unmistakable evidences of much later
civilization. Ruins of buildings are there found in the sand. This
place is supposed to have been one of the northernmost parts of the
Sonrhay Empire, as late as the twelfth century. Mahomed told me
that he had on a previous occasion found stone implements near one
of the wells in Southern Adrar, but he had, of course, not taken
much interest in the discovery or pursued it any further.</p>

<p>In the country between the Niger and Southern Adrar one
occasionally observed tumuli, with remains of pottery, and I had
been told, although I had myself never seen any, that granite and
porphyry pestles and grindstones had been found, with similar
evidences of vanished villages.</p>

<p>It is easy to conjure up pictures of former nations inhabiting
prosperous townships in this portion of the Sahara in olden times,
when the conditions were probably so different from what obtain at
the present day. How strange it is to think that this vast stretch
of country should now be turned into an arid desert. Instead of a
nation dying out as it became effete, in this case it was the
land<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span> which, for
some unknown causes, became so unproductive as to be a country in
which man could not settle for any length of time, and he was
therefore forced to withdraw to more promising lands. When all the
“oueds” flowed, as presumably they must at one time have done, the
Adrar must have been a well-watered land, as must also the whole
region between the Niger and the Ifora country. To all intents and
purposes the Sahara is now a dead world, and although many theories
have been started, and experiments tried, for reclaiming small
portions of it, it can hardly be said that, so far, they have met
with much success even in the circumscribed limits in which they
have been given the most exhaustive trials. However, something new
in science is always being done, and is it not possible that one
day this dead world may be made to live again; that by some
ingenious process water may be made to flow once more in dried-up
“oueds,” and that the country may be refertilized and
repopulated?</p>

temperature — The Sahara by moonlight — Halley’s Comet — Wells of
Abeibera — Tea in the desert — Difficult bargaining — Enduring

<p class="drop-cap">THE camels I had now were far superior animals
to those I had previously hired at Gao. I had particularly
stipulated for animals in the best of condition. Our lives might
depend on the state of the camels on this long trek across the
Sahara to Insalah, a distance of about 950 miles. Besides, this
portion of the desert was a much more serious affair than the part
traversed between Gao and Kidal; it entailed crossing a very large
tract with exceptionally limited resources, even for the camels,
and a region, called the Tanezrouft, in which there was no water
for a distance of 200 miles. Should our camels fail us in the
middle of this great waterless tract we should indeed be in a sorry
plight. I therefore was most careful to see that on starting our
camels were as fit as could be expected for the time of year. They
were fat and had big humps, both of which are unmistakable signs of
good condition in a beast. The hump is the reserve of fat in a
camel. When he is in his pasturage he first of all begins to put on
flesh, and after this he puts on fat in his hump, which until now
has been small and flabby. The hump gradually increases in size
until it has swollen to the normal dimensions for an animal in the
pink of condition. When<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_280">[280]</span> a camel is on the march, even when he is
getting plenty of good grazing daily, he draws to a certain extent
on his hump, which diminishes slowly in size as he uses up this
reserve. When a camel is without food on the march, as sometimes
happens for short periods at a time, the reserve contained in his
hump is drawn upon entirely to keep him going, and this gets
expended very rapidly. As his hump gets smaller the camel loses
condition rapidly, every day his powers of endurance are
diminished, until eventually he can no longer march at all and
dies.</p>

<p>The first part of our march, lying as it did through the
comparatively productive regions of the Adrar, entailed no great
hardships on the camels of the caravan. There was good pasturage
available every day, and every third day we could be sure of coming
to a well, where the camels could drink; but in spite of all this,
in a few days it was noticeable that one or two were deteriorating
in condition. This was probably due to the heat. The time of year
was now at its very hottest. In the vicinity of the tropic of
Cancer from the middle of May to the middle of June the temperature
is at its highest, and the sun’s rays are more powerful than at any
other time of the year.</p>

<p>In consequence of the heat I did a good deal of marching at
night. The hours of march were usually from about 3 p.m. to 10 or
11 p.m., and then a halt and sleep till 4 a.m.; after this we used
to march till about 10 a.m. Marching hours, however, perforce
varied with the state of the country, and the necessity for having
the light of a moon or not.</p>

<p>During the midday halts I had given up pitching my tent, for it
usually took too long as so few men were available to do it; also
it was decidedly hot in a tent, and I found it often cooler under a
ledge of rock or mimosa bush when these were at hand. The nights
were always pleasant, and sleeping in the open was very agreeable;
indeed, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span> used to
get quite cold at 2 or 3 a.m., and I found that my two thick
blankets were quite insufficient to keep me warm. The variation in
temperature was very great. Between midday and midnight there was
frequently a drop of 60 degrees.</p>

<p>When marching by moonlight the scene was indescribably
beautiful. The white sand of the “oueds” in which we were walking
was lit up to look like a white sheet by the brilliant moonbeams;
on all sides of us was this dazzling sheen spread over the surface
of the ground, while in the distance one might have fancied there
were the waters of a lake, so silvery crystal did the sand appear.
The rocky hills on the east and west caught the glint of the moon’s
rays, standing out sharply defined against the deep blue of the
starlit sky. The jagged peaks, which were perhaps succeeded by a
rugged ridge, running thus for miles into the far-off horizon,
looked for all the world like the towers and crenellated
battlements of some ancient fortress. The grandeur of the sight
filled me with a sense of awe, and how many times did I not deplore
my inability to sketch. I used to enjoy walking on these moonlight
nights, gazing at this beautiful scene as we wended our way in
silence through the desert—the stillness being unbroken even by the
noise of a camel’s footfall on that sandy surface. On such a night
the Sahara loses half its terrors. The arid nature of the landscape
is concealed under the cloak of night, and softened by the gentle
rays of the moon.</p>

<p>Even when I was walking it used to get quite chilly towards
midnight, and I longed for the comforting warmth of my coat, which
had been stolen some time previously.</p>

<p>It was about 10 p.m. on the 8th of May, the day that I left
Kidal, that I first saw Halley’s Comet. For many nights
subsequently it was visible in the eastern sky, a beautiful,
bright, luminous body with a long tail, like a streak of fire,
stretching for some distance behind it.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_282">[282]</span> What millions of people in the world must
have been watching it about this time, although I doubt if many had
the opportunity of seeing it from the Sahara.</p>

<p>On the 12th of May we were at the wells of Abeibera, when two
men, with faces concealed in “lithams,” rode up on camels. They had
the appearance of having journeyed far, and it is an unusual thing
to encounter strangers at a desert well, so that I sent Mahomed to
inquire their business and whence they came. The guide came back in
a great state of excitement to say these people were traders from
the Oasis of Touat in the north, and were now on their way to
Kidal. His excitement was chiefly caused by the fact that he knew
the leader of the caravan. The latter, who was an Arab, came up to
salute me presently. He had lost several camels on the way on
account of the excessive heat, but his route had lain considerably
to the west of the direction we should take, so he could not give
any information on the state of the wells we should pass. He had
halted his caravan some distance from Abeibera, and was sending in
his camels to water the following day. He was a very weather-beaten
desert man, was this trader. I suppose he must have been about
forty years of age, although he looked more like fifty, so tanned
by exposure and lined was his face. His caravan was laden with
dates, and he was going to exchange these for sheep and ostrich
feathers. They would probably stay at Kidal till September before
returning to the Touat.</p>

<p>The arrival of the Touat party was the signal for much
tea-drinking. The Arab in the desert is extremely fond of tea,
which he drinks with a great deal of sugar and, of course, without
milk. Mahomed generally made his tea in the English fashion, but
the usual manner amongst Arabs is to put the tea, which is very
strong and green, into a saucepan and stew it. The tea is thus
allowed to stew and simmer for about twenty minutes. The
result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span> is a very
bitter, and to my mind unpleasant, tasting concoction, which has a
very upsetting effect on the nerves.</p>

<p>One virtue possessed by these desert people is that they do not
drink alcohol, nor do they, as a rule, smoke. They have wonderful
powers of endurance, existing on a mere handful of dates as their
daily ration, and drinking nothing but water or tea. Moreover, they
drink very little water. Frequently an Arab will be quite satisfied
after a long hot march to wash his mouth out with a small quantity
and drink nothing at all.</p>

<p>While tea-drinking and merriment was going on by my little camp,
a party of Ifora Tuaregs arrived with their flocks of sheep to
water at the well. Accompanying these men there were also a number
of camels, so that the scene at the well was an unusually animated
one for the Sahara. I tried in vain to purchase a sheep, or even a
little milk, from the Tuaregs, but nothing would induce them to
part with either. I showed them one by one my articles of
merchandise, but they would not be tempted. First the salt was
exposed to view, and they were told they could have a large lump,
which was really worth three times the sheep, but they refused to
look at it, with a fine display of scorn. I next produced a
tempting bait of “guinée,” but this likewise was ineffective,
although they did show a mild interest in the stuff. When, however,
my last remaining head of tobacco was laid out to view, I thought
that at last I had caught my fish, and it only required a little
careful playing before it could be landed. Their eyes glistened at
the sight of the tobacco, and I heard many whispered exclamations
of excitement. In the end I am sorry to say it resulted in
disappointment. They went away muttering something to the effect
that they would rather keep the sheep than take what was offered in
exchange.</p>

<p>Money has no value with the Tuaregs. Any trade is<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span> always done by barter, and the
chief articles of barter are salt and “guinée,” but, in any case,
they are difficult people with whom to drive a bargain, and it is
rarely that a European can induce them to part with anything.</p>

<p>In this part of Adrar, where wells are not more than two days’
march apart, the Iforas possess donkeys. These donkeys are most
wonderfully enduring little beasts. They are trained to go two or
even three days without drinking, and exist on what herbs or grass
they find by the way as they march.</p>

<p>My caravan from Gao had a donkey attached to it, which never
ceased to fill me with admiration. Its Tuareg master had laden it
with a water-skin, which must have weighed about 60 lbs., and in
addition to this it used to carry him for the greater part of the
march. It only got a drink when we arrived at a well, while it used
to snatch at mouthfuls of food if anything came in its way on the
march. This little creature was not more than three feet high, so
it was an amusing sight to watch the long-legged Tuareg seated on
its back, with his legs nearly touching the ground as it walked. It
used to take tiny, quick steps, always keeping pace with the big,
slow strides of the camels.</p>

<p>Having found a fellow-countryman, Mahomed was most anxious to
stop the night at Abeibera, but I was firm, and insisted on
continuing our journey at the usual hour that afternoon. It was the
following day that I saw the last herd of oryx. Between the wells
of Abeibera and Bourassa there was a fair amount of Saharan game.
Loder’s gazelle was the most plentiful, but here, also, I got two
addax besides an oryx. The country was now getting much wilder in
aspect. The rocky ridges on our flanks were higher, “oueds” were
less sandy and more strewn with boulders, while, at Bourassa
itself, the hills on the east must have been at least 500 feet
above the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span> plain. My
calculations made the height of Bourassa 2330 feet, so that the
hills here were about 2800 feet high.</p>

<p>At Bourassa we took two days’ water in the water-skins, as the
next well, called Taoundert, was only some forty miles away. The
country was growing wilder every day, and pasturage for the camels
was less and less plentiful. On the 16th, having arrived at
Taoundert, we found the well quite dry. There was not even a cupful
of water to be got out of it, and we had another two days’ march to
the succeeding well, In Ouzel. There was very little water now left
in the water-skins, so I determined to push on as rapidly as
possible and reach In Ouzel with the greatest despatch the camels
were capable of. But disasters seldom come singly, and the lack of
water was not going to be the only trial the next two days. Halting
only an hour for rest at Taoundert, I pushed on that night. It was
imperative to reach In Ouzel as soon as possible, there was very
little water left in one of the water-skins and nothing at all in
the others; besides, this water-skin was losing the precious liquid
drop by drop as we marched, owing to the usual leakage from these
articles.</p>

<p>The camels, on the march, were always tied in single file, one
animal’s tail being attached by a string to the next one’s lower
jaw. The order of route was, in front the guide and myself, in the
centre my servant Musa, and in rear the camel-driver. It was
necessary to have someone in rear, for sometimes a camel would
break his string and wander away from the rest of the caravan. We
had been marching about six hours when I happened to drop back for
a short time. I noticed, to my dismay, that two camels, those
carrying my food supplies and luncheon-basket, were missing. The
camel-driver, a very sleepy Arab boy of the name of El Bashir, had
mounted one of the animals in the middle of the caravan and was
calmly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span> sleeping on
his beast. There was no sign of the camels, and it was impossible
to say when they had strayed.</p>

<p>I could not afford to lose those camels, for they carried all my
provisions; at the same time it would have been madness to delay
the whole caravan when water was so scarce and time so precious.
The remaining water was divided into two portions, and half was
given to El Bashir. I threatened him with all sorts of penalties
should he dare to return without the lost camels, and sent him off
to look for them, while we proceeded on our way to In Ouzel. Next
day our water was finished, and at midday I made a frugal repast
off the reserve ration I kept always in my haversack. The meal
consisted of a handful of dates and a little “couscous.” I shall
not easily forget the experiences of the next twenty-four hours. We
were all without water, and my “boy” and I were without food.
Mahomed offered me some of his dates, but I was prouder than my
servant Musa, and declared I was not hungry. The heat seemed more
overpowering, and the desert seemed more deathly still than ever,
during that time.</p>

<p>Our throats got parched and our tongues began to swell from the
heat and thirst. How we longed for the sun to set, and the cool of
the evening to relieve us a little from some of our torture! But
that night there was no time to rest, we must march on in spite of
our fatigue. This was a time when rest for ourselves or camels was
not to be thought of, so we trudged wearily on. When the following
day we arrived at In Ouzel we were all thoroughly exhausted, and
the craving for water was something pitiable. Even that hardy
desert wanderer, Mahomed, rushed to the well as soon as it came in
sight, hastily lowering a small leather vessel at the end of a rope
and drawing it up full of water. I must own that I was relieved
beyond expression to see the water, for I had had a horrible fear
that, perhaps, this well too would be dry. I had not<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span> let my thoughts dwell too much
on this possible eventuality, for the consequences would have been
too serious to contemplate. Another fear that had crossed my mind
was that Mahomed might lose the way. Fortunately, all came right in
the end, and even the lost camels turned up that evening. Somehow I
did not seem to feel my hunger so much after we got to the well of
In Ouzel and I had satisfied my thirst, but when the camels did
arrive I soon realized how hungry I really was. After this
experience I determined not to trust El Bashir to do rearguard on
the march, and in future I always put Musa there when I was not in
rear myself.</p>

<p class="justify">When we halted at these wells the Tuaregs were
bringing their flocks down to water. It was pitiful to see the
unfortunate animals endeavouring to get shade behind the trunks of
some leafless trees in the vicinity. The weaker beasts fared even
worse, having to be content with such shade as they could find
under the shadow of their stronger brethren who had usurped the
best places.</p>

<p class="sc">Tuareg Hovels at In Ouzel</p>

<p class="justify">These miserable shelters consist of a few sticks
supporting some goatskins and ragged cloths. The inhabitants have
to crawl in on hands and knees; nor is there standing-room inside.
They are frequently blown down by the terrible sandstorms which
rage constantly here, but possibly their very lowness safeguards
them to some extent from destruction by these hurricanes of
sand.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>After the trying times of the last two days both the camels and
we were greatly in need of a rest, and so it was decided to halt
for three or four days at In Ouzel. This was all the more necessary
as the next stage of our journey would take us through the
Tanezrouft, and to attempt to cross this inhospitable region with
inferior camels would be madness.</p>

<p>We had now passed the rather indefinite boundary between the
portion of Sahara under the jurisdiction of French West Africa and
that part of the great desert which came under the sphere of the
Governor of Algeria. The boundary lay between Bourassa and
Taoundert, running approximately along the 21st parallel. The
country in which we now were was no longer the land of the Ifora
Tuaregs. It was uninhabited except for short periods in the year,
when suitable grazing might be found for a small number of camels.
At such periods a heterogeneous collection of desert nomads used to
make it their temporary head-quarters. These might consist of a
small caravan of Arabs and a few Tuaregs of the Hoggar tribe. The
latter belong to a mountainous desert country lying to the
north-east of In Ouzel.</p>

<p>When I arrived at In Ouzel there were some
half-dozen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span> of these
people still there, although the time of year was not any longer
favourable, and they were already preparing to leave. As nearly all
the pasturage had been eaten up, there was not much left for our
sorely tried camels, and in any case a couple of them appeared too
exhausted for further marching until they had had a long rest.
Mahomed said he thought the short halt we proposed to make would be
sufficient to get the remainder of the caravan in marching trim,
and we arranged with the nomads just departing for the hire of two
suitable baggage camels to replace our jaded beasts. The new camels
were indeed a great acquisition, for they had been in their
pasturage for the past three months, were now in good condition,
and boasting of fine big humps.</p>

<p>My recollections of In Ouzel are the reverse of pleasant. I
pitched my tent on an open space not far from the well, and close
to a dead mimosa, from which I vainly hoped to get a little shade
during the day. Musa rigged himself up a kitchen with the help of
some articles of baggage with one of my tarpaulins thrown over
them, while all the remainder of my kit was stacked in view of the
tent, as robbers have always to be feared in the desert. Things
appeared fairly ship-shape, and I was looking forward to the rest
at In Ouzel, but the day after my arrival I had an attack of fever
which laid me on a bed of sickness. It was at this moment that my
troubles began. From that day until our departure we had a series
of terrible sandstorms.</p>

<p>My tent was blown down right at the commencement, and the force
of the wind was so terrific that attempts to pitch it again were
hopelessly futile. Clouds of sand enveloped my bedclothes and
myself. The suffocating heat of the desert air was intense, while
the sand choked anyone who dared to open his mouth for an instant.
My temperature went up rapidly and refused to come
down.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span> When Musa
tried to give me a glass of cold tea or water it immediately became
filled with sand. I used to hide my head under the bedclothes in
desperate efforts to keep the sand-laden air from buffeting my
face. In all my existence I do not think I have ever experienced
such a miserable time as I did at In Ouzel. Eating, drinking, and
sleeping were impossible, and all the time the fever racked my
limbs and made my head throb till I thought I should go mad. I had
long since discarded my mosquito curtain, so I had not even that to
ward off some of the penetrating clouds of sand, although in the
gales that were blowing I hardly suppose it would have been much
use, even supposing it had not been torn to pieces immediately.
Mahomed was most solicitous, but there was nothing he could do for
me. It was not till the evening before our departure that the fever
left me, and I was glad to get out of my bed of sand, feeling very
weak and shaky.</p>

<p>The nomads encamped here seemed to me to lead a remarkably
wretched existence. Both Arabs and Tuaregs lived in tiny hovels
made of mimosa branches with grass roofs. The doorway was so low
that the occupant had positively to crawl in on hands and knees.
The structures were so frailly put together that they were
continually being blown down by the sandstorms, but possibly the
low height of the hut made it a little less susceptible to the wind
than it would otherwise have been. Some of them boasted of an
additional covering of a few ragged goatskins. Inside, the state of
dirt and squalor was repulsive. I suppose that these desert people
naturally wash little on account of the scarcity of water in the
Sahara; certainly cleanliness is not one of their chief
attributes.</p>

<p>At In Ouzel they owned a few wretched-looking sheep and goats,
but the marvel was that even these could eke out an existence on
the poor nourishment available. For<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_290">[290]</span> them there was nothing but an occasional
small tuft of coarse, dried-up grass. It was rather a pathetic
sight to watch them grazing on it.</p>

<p>In the early morning they were led out by the shepherd across
the undulating sandy surface of the desert, in search of food, and
when one animal, more fortunate than the rest, espied one of these
tufts he would start gobbling it up as quickly as he could. It was
seldom, though, that he was allowed to have his meal to himself,
for a number of his fellows would scamper off to dispute possession
with him.</p>

<p>Another sight, which would be humorous if it were not so
pathetic, is to see these animals in the middle of the day trying
to get a little shade from the blazing heat of the sun. The
strongest of the flock will take up a position behind the trunk of
a mimosa shrub, whereupon the remainder of the party attempt to
benefit by crowding close up to him, one behind the other, until
there is a long tail of these animals, huddled close behind each
other, trying to get some satisfaction out of the shelter
obtainable from the shadow of the sheep in front.</p>

<p>At In Ouzel the character of the desert had changed
considerably. Here was more the popular conception of the Sahara,
and rather what I had myself imagined it always to be.</p>

<p>A soft white sand covered the landscape on every side. At each
step one sank into it for a depth of about a foot. The ground was
undulating, and occasionally sand-dunes, rising to a height of as
much as a hundred feet, were to be seen. Beyond the sparse grass no
vegetation of any sort existed within sight of In Ouzel, but, in
some of the more sheltered “oueds,” lying to the east of the well,
was a tall shrub, with leaves somewhat resembling the Scotch fir.
This was the plant on which the camels fed. It is called “ethel” in
Arabic, and is fairly common in the Northern<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_291">[291]</span> Sahara. I had not previously seen this
desert shrub, but this, I fancy, was due to the desert soil I had
hitherto encountered not being suited to its growth. The “ethel”
appears to require a soft, sandy soil; at any rate, I never found
it growing except in this particular kind of ground. “Ethel” shares
with other Saharan flora the peculiarity of possessing thorns, or
rather, in this case, spikes. It is a curious fact that every herb,
plant, or tree in the desert seems to have some kind of a thorn
growing upon it. The spikes on the “ethel” are perhaps less strong
and hard than in the case of most other Saharan vegetation. It is
rather strange how the camel eats these thorny morsels without
apparently suffering any inconvenience therefrom. By a peculiar
motion he seems to compress the thorns between the roof of his
mouth and his tongue and tear them off. The “cram-cram” grass, of
which the camel is excessively fond, and which is far more
nourishing than the “Ethel,” was no longer to be seen. On quitting
the Adrar we had left it behind. It does not appear to exist north
of that country at all.</p>

<div>
<p class="sc">My Riding-camel in the Sahara</p>

<p class="justify">This picture shows my camel ready to be mounted
after a midday halt, during which I had endeavoured to get some
shade from a leafless stunted tree. My saddle was a Tuareg “rahla”;
these are made with a curious cross in front. All the paraphernalia
of the march is hung ready on the saddle, e.g. rifle, water-bottle,
haversack, and camera. My ammunition I used to carry in a bandolier
slung round the shoulder.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the Sahara there are two kinds of plants, generally
speaking—plants which do not die if they get no rain during the
year, and plants which only spring up annually if there has been
rain. The former species is rather interesting on account of the
following peculiarities. After rain it sprouts forth new branches
or sprigs, and usually remains fairly green for three years, after
which it will dry up, but not die, and will still afford
nourishment for camels for several years, gradually fading away,
and finally dying if it does not get any rain for a period of seven
years. These periods—three and seven years—are necessarily not
exact in every case, but this is said to be the average. This fact,
of course, accounts for pasturage being found in parts of the
Sahara where it has been known not to rain for a considerable
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
</p>

<p>The latter species, viz. the plants which only spring up
annually if it rains, are known to the Arabs by the general name of
“acheb.” It is said that to give life to one of these plants a
heavy shower of rain at least is necessary, and that the soil must
have been saturated for a depth of about four inches. The
characteristic of the “acheb” is that the seed never seems to die.
It merely rests in the ground, waiting for the requisite fall of
rain to spring up. The locality may not have any rain for ten
years, yet the seed will germinate when the rain does eventually
come. “Acheb” of all kinds is eagerly devoured by camels, and most
kinds of it are very nourishing.</p>

<p>There is a totally different sort of flora in the Sahara above
and below the 20th or 21st parallel, and the difference is rather
striking to the traveller, for the change of landscape and climate
to which this must be due is so gradual and so slight as to be
hardly noticeable.</p>

<p>Much of the Saharan vegetation, although so dry and unrefreshing
in appearance, contains a certain amount of liquid. It is this
which enables the fauna of the desert to exist without
drinking.</p>

<p>The question of the different herbs of the desert leads one to
consider the subject of how and when camels should be allowed to
graze. I found I had a lot to learn about this, and it is a most
important item in the education of the desert traveller. Since
one’s mobility, and frequently one’s life, must depend on the state
of the camels in the caravan, the subject is obviously worth
studying. Of course, in some cases forced marches are absolutely
necessary, as when crossing a waterless tract of desert with little
water on the camels. But in most cases the welfare of the camel
must be studied as carefully as possible. Now, it has been noticed
that the camel will eat better at certain times of the day than he
will at others. Between the hours of 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. camels do
not graze. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
generally lie down and rest at this time. Further, they do not
graze between about 2 a.m. and sunrise. They will, practically,
graze all the rest of the twenty-four hours. Experience has also
shown that they graze better on moonlight nights than when it is
dark. With these data as a guide, one can regulate the time of
marching so as to allow the camels to graze at suitable hours. The
authorities say that the animals should be allowed four hours’
pasturage at the very least during the twenty-four.</p>

<p>Another point to be remembered is that camels ruminate, or chew
their food, for some time after grazing. Time should be allowed for
this. When not grazing, and particularly at night, camels can often
be observed chewing. They will go on scrunching their massive jaws
for hours together, while squatting on their hunkers round the camp
after dark.</p>

<p>Camels are strange beasts, passing the comprehension of man in
many ways. I often used to watch them in their pasturage, and think
what antediluvian creatures they appeared to be. The camel seems to
belong to a prehistoric age, and should be classed with the
giraffe, elephant, and hippopotamus, to my mind. He is a sad sort
of animal, seeming never to take any enjoyment in life. Even when
in perfect liberty, grazing, he does not look happy. He only then
seems to be a little less discontented than usual. But with all his
peculiarities and vices a camel is a necessity in desert travel,
and I suppose we should be grateful to him for enabling us to cross
these inhospitable tracts. Without the camel the Sahara would be
even less known than at present.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="chap_sum">The dreaded Tanezrouft — Camel saddles — The
wells of Timissao — A valuable plant — A night march — An
improvised shelter — Sandstorms — Enemies to sleep — Gloomy scenery
— The water supply — An exhausting struggle — The wells of Ahnet —
Instinct of the guides — Protecting the water-skins.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHILE at In Ouzel I had to make a careful
overhaul of my equipment. The portion of desert now close in front
of me was the much-dreaded Tanezrouft, and a journey across it at
any time of the year was not a thing to be lightly undertaken, but
more especially was this the case during the hottest season.</p>

<p>The Tanezrouft extends between the 23rd and 26th parallels in
the Central Sahara, forming a tract of desert in which there is no
water, to all intents and purposes no grazing and, what is still
more inconvenient in many ways, not even any firewood. The
consequence is that all these necessaries must be carried for a
distance of about 200 miles. The width of this waterless region
varies in different parts, but at the point where I was going to
cross it I must expect to take about seven days to accomplish the
journey. This is a tract which must be crossed as rapidly as
possible in order to reach the wells on the north side, for a camel
in hot weather cannot exist more than about eight days without
water; moreover, the water-skins are calculated to leak to the
extent of one-tenth per diem, from which it is evident that a full
water-skin would have lost the whole of its contents by the tenth
day, even if none of the water in it had been drunk. It follows
that any delay over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
and above seven days, in the passage of this dreary bit of desert,
would be extremely perilous for the safety of the caravan.</p>

<p>From the above considerations it is obvious that it was
imperative to be most careful that all details connected with the
equipment and organization of the little caravan should be put into
first-rate working order. It was unfortunate that I had been ill at
this rather critical time, but I had in person seen to as much as
possible, and had left everything else in the competent hands of
Mahomed.</p>

<p>Broken saddles required to be repaired and thoroughly
overhauled, girths had to be mended and renewed, water-skins must
be carefully tested to see they did not leak more than the normal
amount, while camels’ wounds had to be dressed. Besides, the whole
of my kit really needed overhauling, but owing to the sandstorms
constantly blowing, it was impossible to do this. Our greatest
difficulty was with the saddles, for many of these had the wooden
framework broken, and this required to be firmly lashed in order to
make the saddle serviceable.</p>

<p>There are two or three different patterns of pack-saddle used in
this part of the Sahara. The French-made one is much solider than
the native article, but in some respects is less adapted for use
with camels, and likely to give them a sore back if not carefully
attended to. The French saddle, called the Gao pattern, consists of
a wooden triangular frame, made of two horizontal bars on each
side, which are connected by two transverse pieces at the sides,
the apex of the triangle being formed by a further horizontal bar.
This saddle fits on to the camel’s back on the top of two
well-stuffed panels which are filled with cotton-wool. On the
framework are fixed two iron hooks on each side, so that baggage
can be slung on each side of the frame. In most cases the two
panels are sewn together, a hole being cut in the middle to allow
of the camel’s hump<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
protruding. I found that the chief drawback to these saddles was
that the panels were often not long enough; consequently, if a load
was used which projected lower than the panel on the animal’s side,
he was certain to get chafed by the constant friction of the
article against his skin. I saw some nasty wounds which had been
thus inflicted, and these were always difficult to heal.</p>

<p>The native type of saddle, called the “arrej” in Arabic, is a
far simpler affair, made on the same principle but with two light
pieces of bamboo fitting over each side of the camel, and connected
by two diagonal bamboos. This saddle also is kept from pressing on
the animal’s back by means of a cushion of date-palm fibre, while
no girth whatever is used.</p>

<p>Owing to there being no girth, a very nice adjustment of loads
is required to preserve the balance. I have seen some curious
sights with this saddle, too, when a camel has been coming down
hill. If he trots disaster is almost inevitable, for he jogs his
saddle out of place, and equilibrium between the loads is lost, so
that they fall to the ground, saddle and all.</p>

<p>Riding-saddles, called “rahla” in Arabic, are of two kinds—the
Arabic and the Tuareg saddle. These simply consist of a round piece
of wood for the seat, covered with leather, and a peak in front as
well as one behind. In the case of the Tuareg “rahla,” which is by
far the most comfortable, the peaks are higher and the seat wider
in circumference. The shape of the peak in the Tuareg saddle is
rather strange; it is in the form of a cross. The best of
riding-saddles are hard and uncomfortable if the length of march is
above the average. I used to fold a blanket over mine to soften
somewhat the discomfort caused by the hard wood. I never saw a
saddle of European manufacture, but have no doubt that something
far more comfortable could easily be made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
</p>

<p>At In Ouzel Mahomed got rid of the useless El Bashir, and in his
place an Arab friend of his, called Othman, was engaged. The change
was vastly for the better, and I now found things worked much more
smoothly. It appeared that Othman and Mahomed had been partners in
business some time previously, so it was a great stroke of luck to
find him there. It was really essential to have at least two men
with the camels, for if one animal strays while grazing there is
someone left to look after the remainder. As it was, my servant
Musa assisted a great deal in collecting the camels from their
pasturage when we were about to start on a march.</p>

<p>I was more than thankful to leave In Ouzel. My experiences of
the place had been so disagreeable that I hated the sight of it. As
soon as we once more got on the march my spirits rose again and
things assumed a brighter hue.</p>

<p>It was the 22nd of May when we left In Ouzel. Game now was very
scarce, and for about the next ten days I saw nothing more than two
or three Loder’s gazelle in the distance.</p>

<p>We had a march of about ninety miles to the wells of Timissao,
which were on the southern limits of the Tanezrouft; but as we
approached this dreaded region the desert became more and more
forbidding in its aspect. We were now descending rapidly from the
elevated plateau of Adrar to the plain of the Tanezrouft. On the
east was a rocky mass of hills called the Jibal el Tirik, and at
the foot of these there was a small well, but it was nearly dry
when we reached it. There is hardly any grazing-land in this part,
so that it never boasts of even a nomad population. It is
absolutely deserted. From the Tirik hills we passed along a sandy
valley between two parallel ranges of rocky hills for a distance of
about forty miles. The sand here was not like that at In Ouzel, but
resembled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span> the sand
in the south of Adrar. It was as hard and as level as a
running-track. Walking on it was very easy, and I used to march six
or seven hours without feeling the slightest fatigue. In this
valley the colouring at sunset was beautiful. As the sun went down
and its crimson rays faded into a more subdued colour, the rocky
hills were bathed in a lovely deep purple light, creating an effect
many an artist would give a great deal to have an opportunity of
depicting on canvas.</p>

<p>The last eight miles of the march to Timissao lay across the
range of hills which had formed our right flank coming up the
valley. This again was a new kind of desert scenery. Here there was
not a vestige of sand to be seen. Nothing but bare rocks and huge
boulders strewed the way. Marching was difficult for men and
beasts, and at times there seemed every prospect of losing some of
the animals down the precipitous sides of a rocky gully. Camels,
unless specially trained to it, are by no means surefooted on rough
ground; frequently one would clumsily place his foot on a loose
boulder and only recover himself with difficulty. After a long and
excessively hot march we eventually arrived at the well of
Timissao. The well lay in a sandy “oued,” which suddenly emerged to
view as we clambered to the top of the rocky ridge above it.</p>

<p>A few shrubs of “ethel” were scattered along the sides of the
“oued,” and as we arrived a young Loder’s gazelle peered at us with
inquisitive eyes, astonished at this unwonted intrusion of his
desert haunts.</p>

<p>The well of Timissao, the last we were to see for a week, had
the best water I had tasted since leaving Kidal. It was beautifully
clear and fresh, so unlike the wells of Adrar in this respect. A
big ledge of rock projected from the cliff hard by, under which I
ensconced myself for the day. But after breakfast there was plenty
to be done. We had to water all the camels, and must ensure their
drinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span> their fill
before commencing the fatiguing march across the Tanezrouft.</p>

<p>In the sand was made a long, narrow drinking-trough, lined with
stones, so as to facilitate the drinking operations. By this means
we could water some half-dozen camels at a time.</p>

<p>Mahomed and Othman were stripped to the waist, busily engaged in
filling up the trough, as the thirsty beasts emptied it, with
buckets full of water, drawn up in the “delou” from the well. It
was a curious sight to watch the animals’ sides swelling to huge
dimensions as they drank. I would notice a camel, apparently thin
and wasting away, with his ribs all showing, come up to the trough,
and after his drink he would look positively sleek and fat. When
camels do drink they are greedy drinkers.</p>

<p>An animal consumes from eight to ten gallons at a time. But to
allow him to drink all he is capable of, it is necessary to let him
return two, if not three times to the trough. After drinking three
or four gallons he will withdraw, and should be allowed to return
in a couple of hours or so for a further ration of water, and so on
till he is satisfied. For this reason it is advisable to commence
the watering in the morning, in order to finish in one day.
Further, camels are naturally thirstier, and drink better, when the
sun is hot, than they will do at night. Watering was not thoroughly
finished till 3 p.m., and Mahomed was anxious to get the caravan
under way that same afternoon, so as to delay the passage of the
Tanezrouft as little as possible. Accordingly the camels were
loaded up with the baggage as soon as they left the water-side. A
very different appearance did they present now they had satisfied
their thirst to the utmost. I have no doubt they realized they were
now going to be called on to undertake a tougher job than usual,
and so must be well provided with their reserve of water for the
occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
</p>

<p>On quitting the well of Timissao we at once entered on the
Tanezrouft. Quickly leaving the rocky hills behind us, we emerged
on to a bleak, arid waste, consisting apparently of a vast plain of
hard sand, with, on the east, a faint line of hills in the far
distance. These hills marked the southern part of the Hoggar
country, a land in which the nomads are Tuaregs, of whom I heard
and saw more later on. Our way lay almost due north, across this
seemingly endless, inhospitable plain of sand. We were now carrying
water, food, and wood for the needs of the whole caravan, both for
men and beasts. The wood we had collected with some difficulty on
the march that morning early, and it chiefly consisted of dried-up
mimosa twigs, but this was supplemented by a dried-up plant which
is found in the Sahara, called “harta” in Arabic, or “aresou” in
Tuareg. The latter fuel is a most useful article, being quite
invaluable in many parts of the Sahara, where trees and shrubs are
not found. It is a plant to which the camels are very partial when
in flower, but when dried up it resembles a bunch of withered
twigs.</p>

<p>About 7 p.m. we halted for the evening meal. There was to be
little sleep for anyone the next seven days. The halt to-night only
lasted till the moon rose, and then we were off once more. That
night we marched from about 9 p.m. till dawn, without a halt. For
the first time for months I saw a cloudy sky. The night was very
dark, as the moon became obscured behind the clouds soon after she
rose. It was a marvel to me how Mahomed found the way. Even had the
route been a clearly defined track it would have been none too easy
on such a night. But these desert guides seem to be gifted with
almost supernatural powers of vision, and I never saw him hesitate
once. I walked, as I found it was the only way to keep awake. When
I felt a little tired I mounted my camel, but soon became drowsy
and began to nod; then I felt myself<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_301">[301]</span> falling off the animal’s back, and just
woke in time to avoid a disaster. It was a long way from the
camel’s back to the ground. A fall would have possibly involved a
broken leg, so I decided to choose the lesser of the two evils and
dismount again.</p>

<p>I was not sorry when the day began to dawn. At any rate, it was
now light and possible to see one’s surroundings. We now halted for
ten minutes, while the devout Mohammedans said their prayers. It
was a picturesque sight to watch these men turn their faces to the
pink flush in the eastern sky and kneel piously on the desert sand
while they uttered the morning prayer, bowing themselves every now
and again to the ground in obeisance to their God. After this short
halt we marched on till the sun grew too hot, about 11 a.m. From 11
till 2 p.m. we again halted, although it can hardly be said that we
rested. The heat was suffocating. There was no shade anywhere. The
only possible hope of getting a little shelter from the direct rays
of the sun was to rig up a <i>tente d’abri</i> of some description.
I had long ago given up using my own tent for this purpose; and in
the Tanezrouft, where one was fatigued after a long march under
trying conditions, it was still less practicable to pitch it.</p>

<p>I improvised a tiny shelter with a waterproof sheet, to the ends
of which were attached four strings. Making use of a couple of
short bamboos, or sometimes of my rifles in the daytime, when there
seemed no chance of danger, to support this sheet, I succeeded in
contriving a small place in which I could sit down. The height was
sufficient to permit of my keeping my sun-helmet on my head while
in the sitting position, and the length was enough to allow me to
stretch my legs to their full extent and yet be thoroughly
protected from the sun. The four ends were tied by their strings to
articles of baggage.</p>

<p>My “house” was certainly better than nothing, but<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span> it can hardly be said that it
was comfortable. My position was cramped and tiring, while the heat
inside was very oppressive. A further inconvenience, and the worst
of all, was that, when a sandstorm arose, I was exposed to it from
two sides. It was impossible to make the covering air-tight enough
to keep out the clouds of sand. I tried to close all openings with
my available blankets, but the result was very poor, and in the end
I had to resign myself to the inevitable and get “sanded”
patiently!</p>

<p>The sandstorms were very frequent in the Tanezrouft, and much
worse than I had hitherto experienced. The days succeeded one
another without great variation in the monotony, for except for the
degree of violence in the sandstorms, one day was almost exactly
the counterpart of another.</p>

<p>These sandstorms were really the most horrible feature of that
dreaded waterless desert. The storm would begin with little
warning. All of a sudden in the distance there would appear a dense
greyish yellow cloud, whirling rapidly towards us from the distant
horizon. This was preceded by an intensely hot wind, resembling
somewhat the hot-air blast from a furnace when the doors are
opened. This hot wind carried with it countless scattered particles
of sand, the scouts, as it were, of the storm which was following,
and sent on to find out what human beings or animals were there to
become the object of its attack. This preliminary wind, with its
accompanying sand, was a mere bagatelle. The real trial was to
follow. Close on its heels came the sandstorm—a whirling, densely
packed bank of sand, hurrying forward at a headlong pace, blinding
and overpowering everything with which it came in contact.</p>

<p>Before one of these terrible storms it is impossible to stand up
without the danger of being overcome. The only plan is to fall on
the ground and cover up your face,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_303">[303]</span> lying there until the storm is past. The
camels instinctively do the same. They know, even quicker than a
man, when a sandstorm is coming, and prostrate themselves before it
arrives. These sandstorms are awful things, to which even the most
experienced and philosophical of Arabs never get used. Instead of
cooling the air, they seem to make it hotter. The heat when a
sandstorm is about is remarkably oppressive. Just before and after
a storm of this description the sun is seen through a haze,
reminding the spectator of the appearance it has in London on a
foggy day. Of course, while the storm is raging no sun is to be
seen. Indeed, the air is so thick with sand that it is impossible
to see more than a few yards. Moreover, the person who raises his
head when a really bad storm is raging is foolhardy in the
extreme.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw1" id="i35"><img src="images/i35.jpg" alt=

<div>
<p class="sc">My Servant Musa in the Sahara</p>

<p class="justify">This faithful Hausa servant accompanied me
uncomplainingly through the hardships of nearly two months’ desert
travel. It will be noticed that his garments are rather the worse
for wear, and, indeed, he was in a far more deplorable condition in
this respect by the time we reached Insalah. He, like myself, was
obliged to adopt the “litham,” to prevent the blinding and choking
effects of the sand.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Besides making one’s eyes very sore and mouth very parched in
spite of every precaution, I found that it made my nose bleed, so
great was the irritation caused by the gritty particles of sand. It
was rare to have a sandstorm at night. I recollect only one case,
and in that instance it was not very severe. These storms usually
sprang up about 9 a.m., and raged discontinuously until 5 or 6
p.m.</p>

<p>It was bad enough for me, but in many ways I pitied the
unfortunate Musa most. He, after a long, weary night march, was
perhaps trying to cook my simple repast at midday, when a sandstorm
would come up with its usual impetuosity and bury everything in
oceans of sand. I must have eaten gallons of sand on this portion
of my trek. I often marvelled that it did not make me ill, but I
never noticed any unpleasant effects except for the disagreeable
taste at the time.</p>

<p>During these fatiguing days I found it impossible to sleep at
the midday halt, tired though I was. The discomfort of the interior
of my shelter, even when it was not enveloped in a sand-cloud, was
so great that sleep was out<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_304">[304]</span> of the question. I always longed to start
on our weary way once more. But the camels had to rest, and the
Arabs and Musa appeared to find no difficulty in slumbering, for
which I heartily envied them. The only time I managed to sleep was
during the short rest in the evening after dinner. The hour of our
departure at night varied with the time of moonrise, but the
evening rest rarely exceeded two to three hours. Altogether we used
to march about eighteen hours out of the twenty-four.</p>

<p>Even when sleeping in the Sahara it behoves the traveller to
have one eye open, for there is always the fear of possible attack
from desert robbers. I used to be very particular at night to
secure the safety of the camp as far as I could. On arriving at the
halting-place the camels were formed in a small circle, each one
depositing its load at the spot where it had halted. A miniature
zariba of baggage was thus formed. At the rear end of this I would
have my bed pitched, and never went to sleep without having my two
rifles loaded by my side. Danger in the desert generally coming
from the rear, I was in a position to meet it at once, for I am a
light sleeper. I could not depend on the Arabs or my servant to
keep watch in turns, as I had previously intended them to do. In
any case in the Tanezrouft the men were generally so weary that it
was almost impossible not to drop asleep.</p>

<p>On the 29th of May, the fourth day of our journey through the
Tanezrouft, the monotonous stretch of sandy plain which we had seen
without interruption since leaving Timissao, gave way to a
different nature of scenery. The country now became rocky and
hilly. Barren, rugged peaks of isolated hills appeared. These rocks
were of granite, split and cracked into hundreds of clefts by the
action of the powerful sun. Although the sandy plains we had been
crossing until now were dreary, desolate expanses, yet, in some
ways, the gaunt, gloomy rocks before<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_305">[305]</span> us were suggestive of a terrible loneliness
too. On those gloomy but scorching hill-sides there existed no
living thing. That parched-up land of desolation was the home of
eternal death. The tops of the rugged peaks rose some three or four
hundred feet above the surrounding plain, and I dare say, if some
enterprising person cared to climb to the top, he would have a view
over the whole Tanezrouft from one side to another, for the
atmosphere is extraordinarily clear when no sandstorm is
blowing.</p>

<p>This rocky spot in the centre almost of the Tanezrouft is known
as In Zize. We were to camp on the other side of these hills at
noon that day, and as we marched we saw some human skulls and the
skeletons of three or four camels. The ghastly remains of some lost
caravan. The bones, and in some cases the skins, were perfectly
preserved. Here there were no vultures or wild animals to feast on
the bodies, nor was there any damp to rot the skin. It was not
difficult to surmise how this caravan came to perish. In the desert
it is nearly always the same story. Either through losing their
way, or an accident to the water supply, a caravan struggles on
until it is exhausted and dies of thirst.</p>

<p>After quitting this place of rocks the desert resumed its former
appearance. The interminable stretches of hard sand seemed to
extend into infinity. As a rule it was flat as a billiard table,
but here and there could be seen a small sandy mound or undulation
which probably served as a landmark to the guide. Our daily marches
averaged forty-eight kilometres, about thirty miles. As the camel
is a slow marcher when laden, and sandstorms greatly interrupted
progress, the distance covered was considerable. Besides, the
animals were now weary and had some difficulty in maintaining even
their usual pace. I was obliged to discard some of my baggage,
chiefly ammunition, heads, and “couscous,” in order to lighten the
loads.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span> The water
supply was lightening itself with alarming rapidity, and required a
watchful eye. Musa was the chief, and indeed the only, offender.
The negro is used to drinking a great deal of water, being ignorant
of the virtue of self-control in this matter. I several times
caught him taking surreptitious draughts at the water-skins, and
had to check him severely. The heat, and thirst engendered by it,
were certainly intense, so that I could not help secretly
sympathizing with him, although it was necessary to be harsh. The
daily ration of water was doled out twice a day—at the midday halt,
and again in the evening—and at no other time was anyone allowed to
touch the water supply.</p>

<p>Each day passed in the same fatiguing, wearisome manner. Long,
exhausting night marches, a halt in the midst of heat and
discomfort, followed by further marching in the afternoon, until,
by the evening halt we were dead beat. And all the time, at short
intervals, we had those horrible sandstorms. At night, while
marching, it is true, we were exempt from the trials of a
sandstorm, but by that time we were so tired that we marched
sullenly on more like machines than men. The trials of those days
in the Tanezrouft are not easily to be forgotten. Sometimes I used
to wonder if there would be any end to it. The place in my
imagination conjured up ideas of what the infernal regions must be
like. A continual struggling forward with endless difficulties to
contend against. To all intents and purposes no rest, a thirst that
could never be quenched, and an utter distaste for the monotonous
diet of dates and “couscous” well mixed with sand!</p>

<p>I often now wonder how one got through those weary days. When we
halted in the daytime, as I could not sleep I used to attempt to
write and work up my notes, but the discomfort was so great that
the work I got through did not amount to much. Towards the end
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span> water we had to
drink was so disgusting, owing to the time it had lain in the
water-skin, that the only way I could drink mine was in the form of
tea. Fortunately I was well provided with tea all through my Sahara
trek, and I used my ration of fuel in order to boil water for
tea.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw1" id="i36"><img src="images/i36.jpg" alt=

<div>
<p class="sc">My Arab Guide, Mahomed-Ben-Kaid-Kaddour</p>

<p class="justify">This man, to whose skill and endurance I am
indebted for safely crossing some eight hundred miles of the Sahara
wastes, was a typical, hardy desert wanderer. With a cupful of
water and a handful of dates as his daily ration he would bear the
scorching heat and suffocating sandstorms without showing any signs
of fatigue.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the sixth day we crossed a series of parallel ridges of
sand-hills. The sand here was, of course, quite soft, and the
camels’ feet used to sink several inches deep into it. These
sand-hills appeared to stretch as far as the eye could reach to the
west, and possibly have some connection with the hills of moving
sand known as Amool Gragim, which lie to the north of the desert
salt-mines of Taudeny.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 1st of June, just before sunset, we
arrived at the wells of Ahnet, having, to everyone’s joy, at last
emerged from the desolate wastes of the Tanezrouft. Here there was
fair pasturage for the camels, and everyone was in need of a rest,
so I halted for a day and a half.</p>

<p>Some of our animals were in a bad condition. The march had been
more than usually trying owing to the heat, and to the fact that
caravans so rarely travel at this time of year in consequence. A
feeling of satisfaction came over me at the thought that the worst
was now over, for the strain of the last few days had been almost
intolerable.</p>

<p>One of the most marvellous things about desert travel in the
Sahara is the extraordinary instinct for finding the way possessed
by the guides, and already referred to.</p>

<p>For miles and miles on the Tanezrouft there was, as far as I
could see, no landmark of any description to assist Mahomed, yet he
never erred. On this vast plain it would be extremely easy to miss
a well, for an error of a few minutes in direction, when prolonged
over a distance of about 133 miles, would bring the caravan to a
point many miles away from the well on one flank or the
other.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span> For this
very reason a compass is not of much use in desert travelling. The
guide’s knowledge and instinct must alone be relied upon. Of
course, the sun and stars give a good guide a very fair indication
of his direction, but as I have just hinted, a greater degree of
accuracy than this is imperative, for, surrounding a well, for many
miles there are probably no landmarks to help the guide, and the
well itself can usually not be seen till it is actually
reached.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the Tanezrouft Mahomed’s sight began to get
weak. He had probably strained his eyes by continually gazing at
the far-distant horizon. I gave him some lotion from my small stock
of medicines which did him good in a few days.</p>

<p>In the desert one of the commonest diseases, if not the only one
observed in this healthy region, is ophthalmia. It is said to be
produced by the sand which is always in motion in the atmosphere.
Grown-up people and children alike suffer from it.</p>

<p>Our chief source of anxiety was always the water. The skins, or
“guerbas,” in which this is carried are extremely susceptible to
injury. Thorns, which are so common in the Sahara, penetrate the
soft goatskin with ease, causing a puncture which very soon empties
the bag of its precious liquid. For this reason great precautions
are necessary, when a halt is made, that the water-skins shall not
be placed on the bare ground on being taken off the camel’s back.
It is essential to place something firm underneath. Further, the
“guerba” should be covered over in the daytime to prevent it from
perspiring unduly on account of the heat. In the desert one gets to
care for one’s water supply with extraordinary solicitude. But this
is hardly to be wondered at, since it is the very soul of existence
there.</p>

<p>These water-skins each carry about six gallons when<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span> full. They resemble the
“mussock” of the Indian “bhisti,” and have one end left unsewn to
act as a mouthpiece. This end is tied up with string on the march.
The “guerba” is slung, by means of a rope attached to two of its
corners, across the hooks on the pack-saddle. At first I used to
carry a water-bottle on my own camel, but latterly I rejected this
in favour of a small “guerba,” which carried about a gallon of
water and kept it far cooler. I never used a filter, and sometimes
was obliged to drink the most filthy water, which under ordinary
circumstances one would not have washed in. I must say that I
seldom felt any ill-effects for long, after drinking this
unwholesome stuff, and can only attribute it to the fact that one
keeps in marvellously good health in that dry atmosphere.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="chap_sum">The Ahnet or Western Hoggar — A bad reputation
— Tuareg highwaymen — A salt well — A barren region — We reach
Insalah — A dramatic entrance — Colonel Laperine — Insalah — Its
importance — Resources — Artesian wells — Varieties of dates —
Pasturage — The streets.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE region of the Tanezrouft, which we had just
quitted, divides Adrar from the Hoggar country, and it was into the
Ahnet, or Western Hoggar, that we had now emerged. The subsoil of
Hoggar Ahnet consists of a certain amount of clay underneath the
sand. In this respect it differed from the Tanezrouft, which has a
large proportion of salt in its subsoil. The salt is, of course, to
a great extent responsible for the barrenness of the
Tanezrouft.</p>

<p>Western Hoggar consists of a plateau, about 200 feet lower than
the Tanezrouft, the average height of which is 1200 feet. The whole
of Hoggar is a mountainous country, situated almost in the middle
of the Central Sahara. The nomads, as has already been stated, are
a tribe of the Tuareg race. Their country is poor, as is only to be
expected in the Sahara, but at the same time a little barley is
grown in certain parts, while a small grape is also known to exist.
These Tuaregs have a certain number of sheep and goats, but they
are far inferior in quality as well as numbers to the flocks of the
Iforas. Indeed, the Hoggars buy goats and sheep from the nomads of
Adrar.</p>

<p>The Hoggars had a most unenviable reputation as the greatest
robbers in the Sahara until quite recent years. The French desert
columns have, however, inflicted some<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_311">[311]</span> severe lessons on them, and they are now no
longer so much to be feared as formerly. That they have not
altogether abandoned their marauding propensities, however, I was
soon to discover for myself.</p>

<p>The Hoggar country is well placed for its nomads to practise
their robberies. This land lies on the flank of the trade routes of
caravans proceeding from the north to the Niger, or to Domaggoran
and the Hausa States. Hence the Hoggars were greatly feared by
these caravans for many years. If a caravan was not well protected
it was sure to fall a prey to their plundering bands, while
isolated parties of two or three men and a few camels ran
considerable risk of being captured and killed by them. These
Tuaregs, like nearly all their race, are not traders. They have
none but the most meagre resources in their own country, therefore
they had to plunder to live. In the desert they have few superiors,
and are adepts at handling camels. In some parts of their country
water is comparatively plentiful, while owing to the height of the
mountains the cold in the night and early morning from October to
January is very great. The highest peak, Mount Illimane, rises to a
height of 9000 feet, and I have been told that Tuaregs state that
snow has been seen on it. Hoggar Ahnet is in the nature of a flat
spur projecting from this otherwise mountainous country.</p>

<p>At 2.30 p.m. on the 3rd of June we left the wells of Ahnet. This
was now the last stage of the march to Insalah, and as time was
getting short I was anxious to push on as rapidly as possible. I
calculated I had still 800 miles of desert to traverse before
reaching the Algerian railways, and as my leave expired on the 10th
of July I should have some difficulty in reaching England by that
date.</p>

<p>Compared with the Tanezrouft this land appeared to be a smiling
garden, so sharp was the contrast! Here there<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_312">[312]</span> were wide “oueds,” with good grazing for
camels, and the relief at seeing even that dried-up Saharan
vegetation was indescribable. Wells were by no means numerous,
however, and between Ahnet and the next well, called El Jibal,
there was a stretch of eighty-eight miles, or three long days’
march. It was while traversing this piece of desert that we had an
encounter with some Tuareg highwaymen.</p>

<p>One afternoon, about three o’clock, I noticed three wild figures
riding rapidly towards us on camels. They were approaching from the
south-east, so presumably came from the interior of the Hoggar
country. I called Mahomed’s attention to them, and instinctively
felt for my rifle, which I always carried slung at my saddle. The
small rifle was similarly slung on the saddle of my servant, and
both were always ready for use.</p>

<p>Mahomed was armed with an old French Lebel rifle and was, I
knew, a good shot. Othman had only a flint-lock muzzle-loader,
which was of doubtful value even if he were an expert marksman. In
the Sahara no one travels unarmed, so we were not surprised to see
the new arrivals had weapons. But they were literally armed to the
teeth, so appearances rather suggested they were up to no good.
Each man had an almost new Lebel carbine, with a bandolier full of
ammunition slung beside it, in addition they carried the two Tuareg
swords and a spear each.</p>

<p>Mahomed said nothing in reply to my ejaculation, but I saw him
slip a cartridge into the breech of his rifle, which significantly
showed what he thought of them. I gave Musa a warning word to be on
the alert with the ·303, and by this time they were almost within
speaking distance.</p>

<p>Their appearance was fantastic, reminding one forcibly of the
brigand in a play. The leader, a stalwart man with his face more
than usually enveloped in his “litham,” wore a bright red cloth
thrown over his shoulders, while his<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_313">[313]</span> legs were encased in a pair of gaily
decorated leather boots, which reached almost to the thigh, and
covered entirely the lower part of his baggy white trousers. The
two followers were similarly attired, but less elaborately, and
appeared considerably inferior in rank. All three were mounted on
the shaggy-haired camels which are bred in the mountainous country
of Hoggar. These beasts looked built for speed, and appeared to be
in first-rate condition. Until I was more certain of their motives
I did not produce my rifle, although I was ready to do so at an
instant.</p>

<div>
<p class="sc">Arab and Tuareg</p>

<p class="justify">Typical nomads of the Sahara. Observe how their
faces are covered with a veil (“litham”) to keep out the desert
sand.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the time I was in rear of the little convoy, and the leader,
closely followed by his companions, rode rapidly up to Othman, who
was in front with Mahomed. Two men roughly seized Othman’s
“mesoued” (leather kitbag), while the third got in front of him,
laying his hand on his rifle. Their movements, evidently carefully
prearranged, had been so rapid that all this had happened in a few
seconds. I at once produced my rifle, urged my camel forward, and
ordered them to desist. My knowledge of Temacheq, as the Tuareg
language is called, was limited to a few words, but, on hearing my
tone of voice, they immediately looked towards me, and I covered
the third member of the gang with my rifle. He let go his weapon at
once, and the other two desisted. By this time Musa and Mahomed had
also got their rifles raised, and they realized, I suppose, that
the game was up. I can only imagine that they took it for granted
that we would be cowed at their overbearing demeanour, otherwise
their action in plain daylight would appear very foolish.</p>

<p>I told Mahomed to tell them to clear off at once or I should
make them prisoners; at the same time we relieved them of their
ammunition, without which they were harmless. I could not carry
their rifles, so left them in possession of these. Moreover, rifles
are fairly easy to replace, as there is so much gun-running in
North Africa, but ammunition<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_314">[314]</span> is very hard to obtain. So ended this
little incident, which was my only experience with desert robbers.
It was perhaps fortunate that this party was such a small one, but,
in any case, we were well armed, and could always have given a good
account of ourselves.</p>

<p>After descending from the plateau of Ahnet we approached the
desolate region called Mouyidir, which lies between Ahnet and the
Tidikelt country. It first appeared as a frowning mass of black,
rocky hills on the east, which got nearer to us as we advanced each
day. Finally, we were marching on the western border of the
Mouyidir country. At this point was a well, called Imbelram, which
we reached on the 8th of June. This well was so salt that the water
was almost undrinkable. My first draught of water made me ill, and
it had an unpleasant effect on all who drank it. However, we had to
fill up our “guerbas” with this water, for there was ahead of us a
waterless region, about eighty miles wide, which was a part of the
Mouyidir plateau.</p>

<p>In some respects this region was as inhospitable as the
Tanezrouft, but a scanty amount of pasturage and fuel existed for
the first fifty miles, the remainder of the desert being absolutely
without any vegetation whatever.</p>

<p>Mouyidir is a district in which rain seldom falls. For the past
seven years there had not been a drop, so it was hardly to be
wondered at that there was little vegetation in the land. The
plateau is of chalky soil, the northern part being cut up with
numerous slaty gullies. Although sandstorms were less frequent here
I found the heat more trying than in the Tanezrouft. The highest
shade temperature I recorded was 111·5 degrees, and possibly we
were fatigued by our previous experiences, so noticed the heat more
than we should otherwise have done.</p>

<p>Musa was quite overcome on two occasions, and I began to feel
glad we were so near Insalah, where he would be<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span> able to rest. Poor Musa by
this time had assumed a woeful appearance. His clothes were in such
rags that he had to discard his nether garments altogether, and
turn his coat into trousers, by using the sleeves for his legs!
Around his body he carelessly flung his blanket, thus creating such
a ludicrous object that I could not help laughing when he first
showed himself in his new attire. My own scanty wardrobe was sadly
in need of repair, so I also longed for a chance of mending my
clothes.</p>

<p>At this time I had, fortunately, one water-skin of fairly good
water remaining from the previous well, so decided to use it, only,
for the passage of the Mouyidir desert as long as it would last.
The salt water of Imbelram not only made me ill, but seemed to
increase, instead of alleviating, the thirst. Here again hard
marching was the order of the day. The distance to the well of El
Gouirat on the north side was covered in fifty-four hours; and the
last fifty-five miles took no more than thirty-four hours, in which
we only rested for four hours altogether. I must own to being
greatly fatigued on arriving at the well of El Gouirat, but as
Mahomed declared it was “quite near” to Insalah, indicating that we
could reach it in three hours, I decided to go on with him that
afternoon, leaving the baggage to follow with Othman and Musa the
next day.</p>

<p>I suppose Mahomed’s joy at being so near his destination made
him exaggerate, for, to my cost, I discovered it was about twenty
miles to the oasis, and we did not arrive till eight o’clock that
night. Our camels were weary, and we were not a whit less so when,
at last, we saw the palm trees of the oasis in the distance.</p>

<p>As we rode over the crest of a sandy ridge Mahomed pointed in
front of us to a faint, dark line, just visible in the rapidly
falling dusk. The houses I could not see; even in the daytime they
are difficult to distinguish from the surrounding sand until one is
quite close to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
</p>

<p>My entry at the officers’ mess was a strange one. The Arab
servant who answered my summons at the door regarded me with
evident suspicion. Probably the only Europeans he ever saw were the
officers with whom he was well acquainted, and the sight of a
strange white face seemed to cause him great uneasiness. He
positively refused me admission, so I brushed past him and mounted
some steps towards the flat roof on which I could see some men
sitting. When I announced myself their surprise was hardly less
than that of the servant. They afterwards told me that they had
heard news of my projected journey during the previous October,
nine months ago. They had expected me to pass through Insalah in
March or April, and, as I had not arrived, they thought I had
probably abandoned my plan or come to grief in the Sahara. No
wonder, therefore, that my appearance now caused them some
surprise.</p>

<p>When I arrived that night, the 12th of July, the heartiness of
their welcome could not have been exceeded. It made one really
appreciate kindness when it was extended, as it was by these French
officers to me, with such thorough genuineness.</p>

<p>At the risk of being accused of gluttony, I must acknowledge how
I enjoyed my supper at Insalah that night. After eating food cooked
in sand for the past five weeks it was a treat to have a
well-served-up dish.</p>

<p>It appeared that the Commandant, Colonel Laperine, was away, a
piece of news at which I was much disappointed, for I had heard so
much of his fame as a soldier skilled in desert warfare, that I had
looked forward to this opportunity of meeting him. In the Central
Sahara, I suppose there is no name so widely known and respected,
or feared, as the case may be, by Tuareg and Arab. He had served
for many years with French troops in this region, where only the
hardest and most self-controlled<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_317">[317]</span> men can possibly exist, and on many
occasions had led “forlorn hopes” with brilliant success. Although
he has now left those parts for a high command in France, Colonel
Laperine’s name is one which will live for many a long year in the
Central Sahara.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw4" id="i38"><img src="images/i38.jpg" alt=

<div>
<p class="sc">Insalah Oasis</p>

<p class="justify">Date-palms grow here in profusion, thanks to the
liberal system of irrigation which waters their roots. In the moist
ground at their feet are grown small patches of barley and a few
coarse vegetables. On seeing this vista of emerald verdure, who
would think that for many hundred miles south, east, and west there
is scarcely a green blade, nor anything more restful to the
traveller’s jaded eye than small patches of sun-scorched Saharan
vegetation?</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>I was comfortably housed in the post at Insalah that night, and
the following day my baggage arrived at an early hour, having
marched all night. The exhausted camels were taken away by Mahomed
for a well-earned feed on dates and a thorough rest. Although we
had been fortunate in not losing a single animal during the
hardships of the last five weeks, yet most of them were in a
desperately poor condition, and would need many weeks in a
pasturage before they would be again fit for work.</p>

<p>From Gao to Insalah I calculated I had marched across 936 miles
of desert, and the time taken was fifty days.</p>

<p>I had slept that night on the roof of my house, as I was warned
it would be very hot inside. I awoke very early to find a small
sandstorm raging round me, and jumped out of bed fairly quickly. It
was not till some hours later, when the wind had abated, that I was
able to get my first real glimpse of Insalah.</p>

<p>The officers’ quarters were all inside the fortified post, and
were built with thick walls of red clay. This clay is found in the
desert in certain places not far from Insalah, at some feet below
the sand, and all the huts at Insalah are made of it. Insalah lies
in the middle of a sandy plain, which is enclosed on the east and
west by low ridges of sand-hills. It is one of the oases, and the
principal one, in the region called Tidikelt. It is a date-palm
oasis of some importance. The oasis stretches for a distance of
about three and one-third miles to the west, while the grove of
palm trees is on the average one and one-third miles wide. Insalah
is made up of three “ksours” or villages. The<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_318">[318]</span> total population is about five hundred.
These consist mostly of Arabs, but traders from all parts of the
Sahara, who are constantly arriving on their way through, make a
further floating population of fifty to one hundred souls.</p>

<p>The importance of Insalah is due to its geographical position.
It lies at the eastern extremity of the long line of oases which
commences with Colomb Béchar, extending through Beni Abbes and the
Touat. Owing to this comparatively fertile region of oases giving a
good line of communication into the Sahara from the west, caravans
from the borders of south-west Morocco naturally follow this route
and come to Insalah. From Insalah there are several important
caravan routes leading north, south, and east. The main caravan
route from the north, leading from Biskra to the Niger, passes
through here; while caravans proceeding to Tripoli from the west
also use this route in preference to any other.</p>

<p>Water at Insalah is very plentiful, but slightly salt. It is
found at a depth of about fifteen feet, but the second layer of
water, which is preferable for Europeans to drink, is found at a
depth of thirty feet.</p>

<p>The principal resource of Insalah is its dates. The population
lives on the date harvest, and there is a sufficient surplus for
sale to nomads in less favoured localities in the desert. A small
quantity of corn and barley is also grown by irrigation. The method
of irrigating is worthy of notice. Water is, of course, led from
the wells, of which there are positively hundreds at Insalah. Small
trenches are dug, called “fogara,” by which the water is conducted
from the well to the foot of the palm trees, thus irrigating the
dates. Around the foot of the palms each landowner grows a small
farm of corn or barley. These little farms are irrigated from the
main “fogara,” by minor channels leading in different
directions.</p>

<p>During the past three years the French have bored<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span> numerous artesian wells. The
largest gives an output of 4500 litres a minute. The result of all
this irrigation is to produce a wonderfully verdant mass of
foliage, which is most refreshing to the eye of the desert
traveller, who, like myself, has not seen anything that could be
called really green for many weeks. It cannot be said that Insalah
is a prosperous centre of trade. Beyond a little commerce in dates
it does no business whatever. The inhabitants are poor. The place
is being rapidly encroached on by the desert sand, and, altogether,
its future does not appear bright. In order to prevent the sand
from encroaching desperate efforts have been made to keep it out by
building barricades on the side from which the prevailing wind
blows. These barricades, built on the north-east of the oasis, are
made of batches of palm leaves, placed on the tops of high mounds
or sand-dunes. But Insalah is a place of sand, in which, during the
greater part of the year, a strong north-east wind is blowing, ever
bringing more and more sand into the oasis. The so-called streets
are several inches deep in soft sand, and everything gets covered
with it in the houses.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw2" id="i39"><img src="images/i39.jpg" alt=

<div>
<p class="sc">The Artesian Well of El Barha at Insalah</p>

<p class="justify">By boring artesian wells the French have done
much to fertilize the Insalah oasis. The first layer of water at
Insalah is close to the surface, but is exceedingly saline, which
is seen by the curious crust of salt deposited on the surface of
the sand in the vicinity of a well. The water at this artesian well
rushes out with great force, being led off in various directions by
small channels to irrigate the surrounding land.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter iw2" id="i40"><img src="images/i40.jpg" alt=
"">
<div>
<p class="sc">The Market-Place, Touggourt</p>

<p class="justify">Groups of Arabs are to be seen, squatting in
Eastern fashion, selling their wares at these stalls in the
daytime. The market is also a great place for gossip, where the
news of the desert is dispensed—often highly coloured—to all
comers. One of the chief features here is the tea tavern, much
frequented by these people, who, being Mussulmans, are forbidden,
by the tenets of the Koran, to drink alcohol.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>While at Insalah I went for a ride in the palm groves, and it
was then that I learned something about dates. There are many
varieties of the fruit, but the principal ones are the “grhess” and
the “deglet-nour.” The former is the ordinary date of commerce, and
is the one grown and sold at Insalah. It is the “grhess” which is
eaten by the desert traveller, and it is carried for sale in bags
made of camel’s hair, called “tellis.” A “tellis” contains eighty
to one hundred kilos of dates, and two “tellis” make a camel’s
load. Dates are harvested in September or October. At this period
of the year nomads flock to the oasis to gather their harvest or
buy the fruit if they do not themselves possess trees at
Insalah.</p>

<p>The “deglet-nour” is a finer date. It is, indeed,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span> the date we see in England,
sold for dessert in white boxes. None of these are grown at
Insalah, but they come from the oases in the extreme north.</p>

<p>If rain falls in any quantity where dates are growing the fruit
is ruined. The date tree requires plenty of irrigation at the
roots, but water on the fruit quite spoils the latter. The reason
for this is that dates are covered with a coating of sugar, which
protects and nourishes the fruit, but rain washes this off. At
Insalah, and all date oases, there are swarms of flies. These flies
come to feed on the sugar, just mentioned, on the coating of a
date. The plague of flies in these places is most disagreeable, and
commences from the time the fruit begins to ripen, continuing till
the end of the harvest.</p>

<p>Pasturage for camels is bad and scarce near Insalah. Camels have
to be sent 200 kilometres away to graze, so that, when they are at
Insalah, some other form of food has to be given them. The animals
actually stopping in the oasis are generally fed on dates. These
are broken up into small pieces, and either given raw, or cooked
soft, to the beasts. Dates are an expensive form of diet for the
camel, as his appetite is so insatiable, but at the same time they
are very nourishing. Camels are also fed on barley, but as the
quantity grown at Insalah is so small this form of food is
exceptional.</p>

<p>Some of the streets of Insalah are absurdly narrow. The main
street in the principal “ksour” in one place is barely twelve
inches wide. The ponies of the oasis are very clever at passing
along it—from constant practice, I suppose. The houses at this spot
have been built so close together that little room was left between
them for a street. Insalah has the appearance of an Eastern town.
Arab beggars and cripples are a common sight in its streets. Some
of these are uncommonly dirty, but picturesque. Tattered, flowing
gowns, once white, but now coffee colour<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_321">[321]</span> from the dirt of ages, adorn their lean
bodies; while the older ones have fine white beards, often sweeping
half-way down their breast. The Arabs of this part are fine-looking
men as a rule. They are very pale of complexion, with black or dark
brown eyes, aquiline noses, and white teeth. Most of them are
muscular and extremely wiry. I fancy a great many children die at
birth, so it is a case of the survival of the fittest.</p>

<p>A strange place is this little town of sand, buried in the heart
of the Central Sahara, but although so small, and with such limited
resources, what a paradise it seems to many a wayfarer in the
desert! Here at least it is possible to get shelter from the cruel
sandstorms and from the fierce heat of the sun. At Insalah there is
that precious necessity of life, water. While here, also, a man can
rest, and his camels can be relieved of their burdens. The
necessity for hurrying forward with the restless energy which is
required of a caravan in the Sahara need no longer be exercised.
Peace and rest are the two exclamations which must rise to the lips
of almost every traveller when he sees the Oasis of Insalah before
him.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE morning after my arrival at Insalah the
officer in command of the post came to see me wearing a very
troubled look. I could not help surmising that some serious
incident had occurred, and waited for him to tell me what it
was.</p>

<p>It appeared that a messenger had just arrived in great haste on
a camel from a place called Tit, which was a small oasis in the
Touat region, about sixty-six miles from Insalah.</p>

<p>The messenger, a “Méhariste” of the camel corps, stationed in
the Tidikelt, was one of a column which had gone out with Captain
Niéger, some days previous to my arrival, into the desert west of
Insalah. This column was engaged in some military operations in
that district which were expected to last some time. The news which
he brought was grave. It appeared that Captain Niéger had stopped
at Tit to settle some dispute between two Arabs there. One of these
men, apparently dissatisfied with the decision of the Captain in
the matter, had waited his opportunity for revenge.</p>

<p>When Captain Niéger was entering his tent and had
his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span> back turned to
the man, the latter sprang upon him and stabbed him in the liver.
He then lifted his dagger for a second blow, but Captain Niéger had
quickly turned and caught his hand as it was descending. The second
stab was of no consequence, merely cutting his wrist, but the first
one had caused a dangerous wound. The Captain lay in a serious
condition at Tit. The message urgently asked for a doctor to be
despatched at once. It was further stated in the message that the
would-be murderer was a fanatical Mohammedan, but that he had been
caught, and it was hoped the trouble would not influence other
fanatics in the district to a serious rising. My host was naturally
very disturbed at this news, especially as the Captain was a great
personal friend of his. A doctor was immediately despatched to the
scene of the incident, and we could only hope that he would be in
time to save the officer’s life. It was evident that his condition
was critical, for the Captain had sent a message for his family in
France.</p>

<p>I had now to arrange for fresh camels and a new guide to
accompany me from Insalah to the end of my journey. My original
plan had been to go from Insalah to Colomb Béchar. The latter oasis
lies about 600 miles north-west of Insalah. It is at the rail-head
of the Oran railway. I now found, however, that I should not have
time to carry out this part of my programme, and that I should be
obliged to adopt the shorter route to Algiers, which led almost due
north through the oases of Ouargla and Touggourt. By this latter
route I should be able to join the railway line at Biskra, 125
miles north of Touggourt. Moreover, between Touggourt and Biskra I
could have the benefit of the coaching service, which runs three
times a week and covers the distance in two days.</p>

<p>An Arab trader was found willing to let me have camels and to
act himself as guide. My caravan was to be<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_324">[324]</span> ready on the 15th. I had now consumed, or
thrown away, so much of my ammunition and provisions that I could
with ease reduce the number of baggage animals to two.</p>

<p>A French sergeant, who was proceeding on leave, was to accompany
my caravan. He also had two camel loads. Our two “méhara,” or
riding camels, made the total of the caravan amount to six camels.
The guide had one “sokrar,” or camel driver, to assist him, and
included in the party was an Arab soldier going on furlough to the
north.</p>

<p>Our guide was not a prepossessing individual. He belonged to a
mongrel race who were an offshoot from the big Chaamba tribe. His
appearance led one to believe that he was a lazy and not
over-intelligent scoundrel. However, guides do not grow on every
gooseberry bush at Insalah, so I considered myself lucky to be able
to secure one so quickly.</p>

<p>A question that rather puzzled me was how the news of my
intended arrival had not reached Insalah by the messenger who had
been despatched from Kidal. I was informed, however, that he had
not yet arrived, and, curiously enough, he did not arrive till the
day before I left Insalah. So I had actually travelled more rapidly
than he had done! He had been much delayed by some accident to his
camel and by the great heat on the way.</p>

<p>The camels I was to use were far stronger-looking animals than
any I had seen in the south. On the other hand, the riding camels
of the north are inferior to those of the Iforas. The baggage
camels will here carry enormous loads. It is quite a common sight
to see 400 to 500 pounds on an animal’s back, while they even carry
as much as 600 pounds in some parts. Camels will travel without a
halt for a fortnight with such a load on their backs
without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span> suffering
any ill-effects. But, at the same time, it must not be thought that
these animals will be fit for hard work at once directly they reach
their journey’s end. Like other camels in the Southern Sahara, they
require long periods of rest after accomplishing a long desert
march. Two to three months in perfect liberty in their pasturage is
necessary for a camel in such a case.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw3" id="i41"><img src="images/i41.jpg" alt=
"">
<div>
<p class="sc">The Spring of El Guettera</p>

<p class="justify">This is an unusually attractive-looking spot for
the Sahara Desert! It was the only occasion on which I saw water
flowing out of a spring between Gao and Biskra—1600 miles. A spring
of cool, crystal water flows out of the rock here—a grateful boon
to the thirsty traveller who, like myself, has been existing on
disgusting liquid, made nauseous by several days’ jolting in a not
over-clean water-skin.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>At Insalah there is a fine library well equipped with books on
desert travel. I had little time to do more than glance at one or
two of these, but any desert traveller could not fail to be
interested in much of this literature. One book particularly roused
my interest. This was a work of Saharan travel by a man called
“Père de Foucauld” (the Vicomte de Foucauld), whose name is well
known to men in Central Sahara.</p>

<p>This remarkable man was originally in the French army, but
latterly joined the sect of the “White Fathers.” He has travelled
much in the desert, and a great many years ago executed a wonderful
journey from the Mediterranean through Morocco to the Atlantic
coast in the Spanish colony of Rio del Oro. This journey he
performed in disguise as an Arab, but was discovered by the natives
to be a Christian and a European, and only escaped with his life
after running some extraordinary risks. M. de Foucauld has for the
past few years taken a great interest in the Tuaregs of the Hoggar
country. He resides among them, treating sick people and doing much
good in several ways. He has so far gained their confidence as to
be able to remain unmolested in their wild land. Further, he has
greatly assisted the French Government in stopping the plundering
habits of the Hoggars. He resides in a little hut in a part of
their desert called Tamanrasset, a good many miles to the east of
the route I had taken, and is almost the only European with any
knowledge of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
language of the Tuaregs. He is now engaged in writing a dictionary
which will be of the greatest assistance in the study of
Temacheq.</p>

<p>The horses in use at Insalah come from the north. They are bred
in that part of Algeria called the Tell, which is a region along
the coast of the Mediterranean. These horses seem to keep very fit
at Insalah. They are sturdy little animals, about 13.2 to 14 hands,
rather resembling the Barb, but more stoutly built. All the
Europeans at Insalah keep horses. Of course, these animals are of
no use in the desert, but to ride about in the oasis they are most
useful. The chief difficulty is getting them across the Northern
Sahara to Insalah. They are fed on barley or crushed dates. No
sheep or cows were to be seen, but I was told that in the cooler
season, from October to January, when the caravans are trading with
the Adrar of the Iforas, a considerable number of sheep are brought
here for sale. My guide Mahomed told me that the previous year he
had brought a flock of sheep from Kidal, which had cost on the
average 5 francs a head, and he had sold them at 15 to 25 francs
apiece at Insalah. The profit was good, but obviously the risk was
great, even when wells were more numerous and better supplied with
water than at the present season of the year. Moreover, there was
always the dangerous passage of the Tanezrouft to cope with, and
for that portion of the journey water had to be carried for the
sheep as well as the men of the caravan, thus entailing a huge
number of camels for water alone.</p>

<p>The last morning of my stay at Insalah I was the guest of the
officers at <i>déjeuner</i>. I was much honoured at being the
recipient of many kindly expressed wishes from the good friends I
had made there, and, as they stated, it was rather a unique
occasion for an English officer to be entertained in the Sahara by
officers of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
French army. Many and fervid were the words in which the Commandant
hoped for the continuance of the <i>entente cordiale</i>, and I
could only reply that, judging from my experiences while travelling
through the vast country which was ruled under the French flag,
there seemed little likelihood of the good feeling between the two
countries not enduring for many years to come.</p>

<p>My servant Musa had not yet recovered from the effects of our
trials in the Tanezrouft, and I had some doubt as to the
advisability of taking him any further. Unfortunately, there was
not the slightest prospect of getting a servant of any description
at Insalah. While I was debating this point, however, he hinted at
being frightened of going into Algeria on account of his dread of
being captured into slavery by Arabs. Until quite recent times much
of the slave-trade in the Sahara was carried on by the Arabs. These
people used to raid down into the south, carrying off into slavery
the negroes of the Niger valley. Since the advent of the French
this trade had practically ceased to exist, although isolated cases
did even now occur. Musa had probably heard some of the harrowing
tales of olden days, and seemed to think he would be putting his
head into the lion’s mouth should he venture into the very country
of the Arabs.</p>

<p>In the ordinary course not much harm was done by capturing
slaves in the old days, for they were very well treated, not hard
worked, and well fed. In fact, many of these slaves used to refuse
to take their liberty when it was offered them. But in the case of
slaves being captured by Arabs the position was a very different
one. The Arabs were cruel masters, who beat and sometimes killed
their slaves for the most trivial offences. Hence they were
universally hated and feared by the negro. I pointed out to Musa
that this sort of thing could not easily happen at the present day,
and that with me he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
would be perfectly safe. I think, however, that his nerves were
rather overwrought at what he had suffered, and he hardly seemed to
be convinced. Under the circumstances it seemed more prudent to
allow him to remain behind. Accordingly, I arranged with a French
officer to take charge of him until there was a suitable
opportunity of sending him with a caravan to the Niger in the
autumn. I was sorry to part with Musa for several reasons. He was
an excellent, hard-working, and faithful “boy.” I had hardly heard
him utter a single complaint all through that trying time in the
desert. Moreover, his loss was an irreparable one for me.
Henceforth I should have to cook my own food and make my own bed. I
can hardly say I relished the prospect!</p>

<p>For the first twenty-five miles of our journey north there were
two oases, in each of which the water was obtained from artesian
wells, and was excellent. The idea of finding wells at such close
intervals appeared strange after our former experiences, and it
hardly seemed as if we could really be still travelling through the
Sahara. The intervening country, however, was typical desert. These
two spots had been fertilized by purely artificial means, merely
possible because the water here is plentiful and at no great depth
below the surface of the sand. The surroundings are desolate in the
extreme. A bare, undulating, sandy plain is the characteristic
feature of the whole country. No “oueds” or pasturage for camels
are anywhere available. Not a leaf or blade of grass is to be seen.
Camels are fed on dates procurable at these two oases <i>en
route</i>. At the second oasis, called Foggaret el Zoua, there is a
fair amount of barley grown. After this there was no water for
fifty-seven miles, until we reached the mountain range of El
Guettera. Here there is a spring in the rock, so that one actually
sees a faint trickle of running water—an unusual sight in the
desert, and one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span> I
had not seen since quitting the Niger, nearly eight weeks
previously.</p>

<div>
<p class="sc">The Oasis of Ouargla</p>

<p class="justify">This place might appropriately be called one of
the outposts of civilization in the Northern Sahara. After crossing
over 1300 miles of desert one sees for the first time a collection
of flat-roofed houses, a market-place full of bargaining,
gesticulating Arabs, and that most evident sign of civilization the
electric telegraph. Ouargla exists by reason of her date trade.
Here is grown the finest date of commerce, viz. the dessert date as
we know it in England.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is rather a pathetic story attached to this spring. About
two months earlier, an Arab and his wife were journeying from the
north towards Insalah. They had missed their way and exhausted
their water supply. First, all their camels died by the road, one
by one overcome with thirst. The man and his wife struggled on,
hoping to find the spring of El Guettera, and well aware that it
could not be far off. The woman next succumbed, but the man kept
on, dragging himself wearily along, buoyed with the hope that he
must be close to water. The distance, however, was greater than he
had thought, and he too died. His body was discovered a few days
later by a passing caravan. He had actually arrived within half a
mile of the spring, and if he had only known this, poor fellow, he
would probably have had strength to reach it!</p>

<p>All this time I had been practising doing valet and cook to
myself with indifferent success. I knew sufficient about cooking,
of course, to be able to make simple dishes for myself, having
frequently done this before, as must anyone who wishes to travel.
But when I arrived at the halting-place, generally after a long,
hot march, I felt anything but inclined to begin to cook my own
repast. Moreover, the difficulties caused by periodic gusts of
sand, from which we were not exempt here, made the effort of
cooking most fatiguing. At night, too, I used often to feel very
disinclined to make my own bed, and again to pack it up when we
started once more. Indeed, latterly, I used infinitely to prefer to
sleep on one blanket on the sand to getting out my bed and pitching
it, with its paraphernalia of bedding. The two Arabs were far too
busy with their camels and too ignorant of cooking in any form to
be of the slightest assistance. The same argument applied to the
soldier “Méhariste.” All these people live practically on a
handful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span> of raw
dates, and any form of food different from this is unknown to them.
How I envied them their simple tastes sometimes!</p>

<p>The range of El Guettera forms the south-western border of the
plateau of Tademayt. This rocky plateau runs in a north-and-south
direction, and at its foot lies the region of the oases, viz.
Insalah, Touat, Beni Abbes, and the eastern extremity of Colomb
Béchar. Its elevation above the sea is about 1600 feet. On climbing
up to the top of this plateau we had to follow a precipitous track,
on each side of which was a deep chasm. In the chasms could be seen
the bones of camels, which had evidently, at different times, lost
their footing and perished. Fortunately for us we reached the
summit in safety, but many times a camel’s foot slipped, and his
fate hung in the balance. As we progressed across the plateau the
surface became more sandy and level. Pasturage, too, was more
plentiful, and that night, the 18th of June, we camped in a fine
wide “oued,” called by the name of Musa Benaïsch, and the camels
fairly revelled in the pasturage here, for it was the first good
feed they had had since leaving Insalah, and in any case they
infinitely preferred the “acheb” here to the diet of dates to which
they had so long been accustomed.</p>

<p>Near this spot we came upon an encampment of Chaamba Arabs. They
had a large number of camels and sheep. This was the first time
that I had seen any sheep since leaving Adrar. Of course, they
refused to part with any, so our hopes of fresh meat were soon
dashed to the ground. There had been no signs of game hitherto, as
indeed was only natural, for there was nothing for them to eat, but
now that “oueds” were becoming more plentiful we noticed tracks of
Loder’s gazelle from time to time.</p>

<p>On the 29th of June we quitted the Tademayt plateau<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span> and descended on to a wide
plain of gravelly soil. This plain was flanked on the east and west
by the two great sandy deserts known as the Eastern and Western
“Great Erg” respectively. The character of the country in the
“Great Erg” is unique in the Sahara. The word “erg” in Arabic means
sand-hill. And these two vast deserts consist of wide expanses of
dunes of soft sand. They stretch almost uninterruptedly from
Morocco on the west to Tripoli on the east. Marching in this dreary
region is most difficult for man and beast. At every step the feet
sink deep into the sand. Moreover the sand drifts on account of the
usual prevalent north-east wind, frequently changing the appearance
of the sand-hills to such an extent that guides lose their
landmarks and miss the way.</p>

<p>But although these “erg” appear so barren there is a fair amount
of Saharan vegetation, and pasturage for camels is not difficult to
obtain. The sand is a dazzling yellowish white, but in some
instances one sees several ridges of reddish sand, showing out very
distinctly in contrast to the ordinary colour. From here to the
next well it was a two days’ march. We had already had several
examples of our guide’s incompetence. He often appeared to be at
fault. But it was not till now that he actually lost the way. He
would, I am convinced, have never found it had it not been for the
“Méhariste.” This man was a typical nomad of the Sahara, and,
although having only once previously travelled by this route, he
managed to lead us out of our difficulties to Hassy Inifel. “Hassy”
is the word for “well,” so that nearly every well has the word
“hassy” prefixed to its name in the Central Sahara.</p>

<p>At Inifel there is a stone block-house, built by the French some
years ago, when this was a military post. In it there were two
comfortable rooms, where we could rest<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_332">[332]</span> from the heat of the day. We were now about
half-way to Ouargla, and so the sight of Inifel cheered us up,
making us feel that we had left another milepost behind.</p>

<p>From Inifel the way lay north-east, following close to a big
“oued”—the Oued Mya. This dried-up waterway runs for about 200
miles north-north-east to Ouargla, and must have been an important
river in its day.</p>

<p>Between Inifel and the next well, called Zmeila, there was a
long march of three days, which took us over ninety-five miles of
stony ground, lying several miles to the west of the “oued.” In
this country the camels had rather a rough time, for there was
practically no pasturage for them, and our guide, with his usual
ignorance, or want of foresight, had not arranged to carry any food
for them. To add to his delinquencies, the stupid rascal again lost
the way. At the time we were marching at night. He had pointed to
his “sokrar” the direction in which he said the well lay, while he
made an excuse for dropping in rear of the caravan. I thought he
was an unusually long time in regaining his place, and so turned
back to see what he was doing. I found him peacefully sleeping on a
baggage camel, and, had I not been so angry, I could not have
helped laughing at the humorous spectacle that met my eyes. He was
in a crouching position, half lying on his stomach, with his legs
firmly clasped round the camel’s hump. How on earth he could manage
to sleep in this extraordinary posture was more than I could
understand. His appearance suggested a sack of potatoes thrown over
the animal’s back! I applied my riding-whip pretty freely to a
certain portion of his anatomy, and he awoke with a start, nearly
losing the balance he had so marvellously preserved hitherto.</p>

<p>When he had rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, and seemed to
realize the situation, he looked ahead of him into the expanse of
desert and solemnly declared that we were lost.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span> He said he did not in the
least know where we were, and that it was the “sokrar’s” fault for
not keeping the direction he had given him. We soon came to the
conclusion that he was speaking the truth with regard to not
knowing where we were, and as to the reason how this had happened
it appeared to be immaterial. It is a strange thing how
philosophical one becomes in the desert, and the position, which
was really sufficiently serious to cause anxiety, did not disturb
our equanimity as much as it should have done.</p>

<p class="sc">The Residency at Touggourt</p>

<p class="justify">The official who resides here is a military
officer, and administers a large portion of the Sahara, south of
Algeria, called the “Annexe of Touggourt.” This oasis boasts of a
small hotel and is visited by some of the more enterprising
tourists from Biskra occasionally. The distance to Biskra is only
125 miles, which can be covered in two days by the desert coach
running between the two places.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter iw2" id="i44"><img src="images/i44.jpg" alt=

<div>
<p class="sc">Chaamba Arabs at Touggourt</p>

<p class="justify">A desert caravan has just arrived; the camels
have been unloaded and are going to water. The bags in the
foreground are the familiar “tellis” of the Northern Sahara. They
are made of camel’s hair, are very strong, and are used to carry
dates.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The only thing to do was to strike in the direction in which we
knew the “Oued Mya” must lie, and then follow its course up towards
the well which lay in its bed. As the “oued” wound about
considerably this would lengthen our march a good deal, but this
seemed a more prudent course than to make blind “casts” in the
desert.</p>

<p>As matters turned out, the “Méhariste” again came to the rescue
when day dawned. He rode out at a trot some distance in advance of
the caravan, to scout, and, after an hour or so, he returned with
the information that he could find the well, without the need for
further lengthening our march. He acted up to his promise, and we
thus did not go more than some ten miles out of our way. After this
our journey was accomplished without further incident to Ouargla,
where we arrived on June 29th.</p>

<p>The day before our arrival we passed a small oasis, in which
there lived an influential Arab chief. This man invited me to have
breakfast with him. Knowing that he would be hurt if I refused, and
also that it would be considered, by the custom of the country,
that I wished to insult him if I did not accept his hospitality, I
agreed to come.</p>

<p>My heart misgave me when I saw the nature of the feast provided.
There were several huge dishes of oily-looking<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_334">[334]</span> food, the contents of which could only
be guessed at. One looked less uninviting than the others. It
consisted of rice with some spices, so I hastily indicated that I
would take some of that. But I soon discovered that I was not to
get off so easily. I was expected to partake of all the dishes.
Moreover, if I did not help myself liberally, some
hospitably-inclined follower of the chief would fill up my plate
for me. I groaned inwardly at the thought of having to eat these
horrible-looking things. Finally, I said I was ill after my long
travels and could not eat well, so I hoped the chief would excuse
my small appetite. But the repast was not yet finished. A whole
sheep roasted was now produced. This is prepared in some strange
fashion, being well ladled with oil and covered with chili peppers,
and is the <i>pièce de résistance</i> at an Arab feast. It is
called a “meshoui.” All this time the chief was eating with great
gusto, and what he could not himself consume he handed to his
followers, of whom there must have been at least half a dozen
present. Their manner of eating was anything but pleasant to watch,
especially when I was feeling far from well after partaking of some
of these horrible dishes.</p>

<p>It took me a long time to recover from the effects of that meal,
and I vowed that at the risk of offending the whole of the Arab
race, never again would I consent to touch one of their repasts.
When I related this story to the officers at Ouargla they laughed
heartily, but said they did not wonder at my being ill!</p>

<p>The country all round Ouargla for many miles is soft sand and
undulating. The oasis itself lies in a basin surrounded by low
sand-hills. There are about 3000 sedentary inhabitants, and in the
date season this number is increased by nomads who come in for
dates as they do at Insalah. Ouargla is famed for its fine dates.
These are of the best quality, viz. the “deglet-nour.”
Large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span> quantities
are exported every year to Biskra, whence they are sent to
Europe.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw3" id="i45"><img src="images/i45.jpg" alt=
"">
<div>
<p class="sc">The Mosques at Ouargla</p>

<p class="justify">These narrow, tall mud towers are ascended by a
steep and tortuous stairway. At the summit is a small platform on
to which the “muezzin” climbs when he summons the faithful to
prayer. These Arabs are one and all fervent Mohammedans; a mixture
of creeds such as obtains in India finds no favour with them. The
European is to them a Christian dog whose presence is only
tolerated because he is feared.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>From Ouargla to Insalah it was 390 miles, and we had covered
this distance in fifteen days, without halting for more than a few
hours at a time. This was pretty good going, and our camels were
now showing decided signs of fatigue. I was anxious to move again
as soon as possible, as time was getting very short. There were
still 100 miles of desert between us and Touggourt. I therefore
only stayed two days in order to enable the guide to change the
tired camels, and on the 1st of July we again set forth.</p>

<p>Between Ouargla and Touggourt there are wells almost every day,
and except for the heat there was nothing very trying in the
marches compared with what had gone before. I was now travelling
very light. I had discarded my tent and bed as useless. My stock of
provisions was very low, and at Ouargla I had given away a lot of
ammunition, so that now my effects were not numerous. One baggage
camel amply sufficed for my needs. On the 3rd of July we arrived at
the oasis of Touggourt.</p>

<p>The signs of better accommodation and more comforts in the
everyday existence of the inhabitants had been already apparent at
Ouargla, but at Touggourt this was all the more so. Indeed, from
Ouargla the telegraph runs across the desert to Touggourt and the
north, while at Touggourt itself there are such signs of
civilization as a small hotel and, of course, the coach to Biskra.
At both these towns the Europeans live in well-built houses, some
of which are of stone.</p>

<p>At Touggourt I enjoyed the real luxury of a douche. The officers
there have an ingeniously contrived douche in their gardens, which
is fed by an artesian well. The joy of a proper bath was really
indescribable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
</p>

<p>Touggourt is already within touch of civilization, for tourists,
or a few of the most enterprising among them, come here by the
coach in the Biskra season, and put up at the curious little hotel
of which the place boasts.</p>

<p>From the top of the big mosque at Touggourt a splendid view is
to be had over the desert. I went up there one day with a French
officer to have a good look at the desolate region in which I had
spent so many days.</p>

<p>I now counted my journey as practically finished.</p>

<p>On the 5th of July I took the coach to Biskra, where we arrived
early on the 7th. The coach consists of a ramshackle vehicle,
holding three people on the front and three on the back seat. For
the first sixty-six miles it is drawn by mules, and for the last
eighty-six miles the team consists of three ponies. The track is
well defined, but rather heavy going through deep, soft sand.
Sometimes the passengers have to get out and help to extricate the
cart from the ruts into which it has sunk. The traveller gets well
shaken up on the journey, but after a long ride on camels one
hardly noticed that. The French sergeant accompanied me as far as
Biskra. Biskra did, indeed, mean civilization. Here there was the
railway to Algiers, and the fatigues of travelling were made easy.
At Biskra there are some six or seven hotels, all of which were
empty when I passed through. The season is in the winter, and at
that time of year a considerable number of people visit this
outpost of civilization. Date palms are numerous, and all water is
still obtained from wells. But at Biskra there is no lack of water
close to the surface of the ground. At Touggourt the water is so
salt that all Europeans have to drink it distilled, but this is not
necessary at Biskra.</p>

<p>This oasis is a beautiful spot. Amongst a grove of palms will be
seen a pretty little house, by the side of which is a garden well
stocked with beautiful green shrubs and flowers. All irrigation is
easy here, as water is so plentiful.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_337">[337]</span> Hence the contrast as one emerges from the
desert into this paradise of verdure and colour is very
striking.</p>

<p>I spent only two hours at Biskra. I had just time to don my one
and only flannel suit after drinking a cup of coffee, and pay my
respects to the officer in command of the garrison, when I had to
be back at the railway station, for my train left at 8.30 that
morning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="chap_sum">By rail to Algiers — A difficult project — The
resources of the Sahara</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AS I settled myself in the railway carriage I
had ample food for reflection over the events of my journey.
Naturally the part that had made the most impression on me in many
ways was the journey across the Sahara. It had taken me exactly
seventy-five days to cover the total distance from Gao to Biskra,
nearly 1600 miles. Now that the strain was over I began to feel
really fatigued. It was pleasant to sit quietly in the train and
watch the passing landscape, so different from what I had been
looking at for many a long day.</p>

<p>First the train climbed laboriously up the steep sides of the
mountains, which lead up into the high plateaux of Southern
Algeria. As we stopped at stations and I noticed the number of
Europeans about and the bustle that reigned everywhere as soon as
the train stopped, it seemed hard to realize that I was not
dreaming, and that I should not shortly wake up to find myself
again in the Sahara—among those familiar scenes that I had got to
know so well, and which were all summed up in the one word
desolation.</p>

<p>But as we got on to the plateaux above Biskra we came into a
land of peace and plenty. There were miles upon miles of waving
fields of wheat and barley. Prosperous farms were often to be seen
standing in the midst of their rich agricultural lands. That year
there had been a good rainfall on the plateaux, and in consequence
the crops had done even better than usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
</p>

<p>That night we arrived at the big town of Setif, where I had to
change and wait several hours for the midnight express to Algiers.
I had engaged a sleeping-berth on the train, so I had a comfortable
journey to the capital. When I awoke in the morning we were passing
through rich vineyards, down the western slopes of the Kabyle
Mountains.</p>

<p>I had travelled 3758 miles across Africa, 1560 of which had been
through the Sahara. The whole journey had occupied six months and
two days. My stay at Algiers was short. I caught the first steamer
available to Marseilles, where I arrived on the 11th of June.</p>

<p>On the following night I reached London, travelling via Calais
and Dover.</p>

<p>I was two days late for my leave, but under the circumstances I
had travelled as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>After what I saw of the Sahara I came to the conclusion that the
project of building a railway across from Algeria to the Niger is
never likely to mature. Indeed, I fancy that most Frenchmen who
have any experience of the Central Sahara long ago came to the same
opinion.</p>

<p>The scheme was mooted some years ago as a useful connecting link
between the Algerian railway system and the Niger. The difficulties
in the way of carrying this out are almost insuperable. To start
with, there is no coal in Algeria or, of course, in the Sahara.
Again, if the difficulty of obtaining fuel could be overcome the
constant sandstorms would make engineering works hard to construct
and harder still to maintain. The railway line would probably be
constantly buried in sand, so that some contrivance for clearing
the way in front of the engine would be necessary. Moreover, what
would be the advantages gained by the construction of such a
railway?</p>

<p>The resources of the Sahara are practically <i>nil</i>, while
the total values of the caravans which cross this portion
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span> it do not amount
to 1,000,000 francs per annum. Therefore as a commercial enterprise
the railway could never pay, and the advantage of having this
shorter line of communication between Western Soudan and France, if
it could be constructed, would not certainly be worth the enormous
expenditure involved. Of course, there is always the difficulty of
water supply for the engines. Even along the most practicable
route, from Insalah to Gao, wells are few and far between. The
output is frequently very slow. Artesian wells would have to be
made where possible. In fact, it appears that the resources of the
Sahara are so very restricted and incapable of further development
unless great mineral wealth be somewhere found, that its future
state is not likely to be any brighter than its present condition.
The question as to what the Sahara was originally is an interesting
one.</p>

<p>The Arabs who wander in the desert around the Oases of Touat and
Beni Abbes declare that in ancient times these oases were islands,
and that a very big water existed between them and the sea and
between them and Taudény in the south.</p>

<p>It seems possible that this theory is correct, for there is a
marked depression formed by the Oued Mya, which extends south
through the oases towards Taudény, eventually terminating in a big
basin, called El Djouf, or “the belly of the desert.” Further, from
the formation of the country it seems quite possible that the
salt-water lakes, or “chotts” of Tunisia, which themselves are, or
were, connected with the sea, contributed their waters to this
depression, and thus there was at one time a practically
uninterrupted waterway from the sea to Taudény. The water from this
source then surrounded the oases, isolating them from the rest of
the Sahara, which would bear out the legend of these Arab
tribes.</p>

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
